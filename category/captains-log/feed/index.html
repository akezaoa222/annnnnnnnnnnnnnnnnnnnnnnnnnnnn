					<h1 class="entry-title">Captain’s Log Entry #9 – Combat Mechanics</h1>
				</div>
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Last week I mentioned there might be a surprise for you this week. And here they come: The very first screenshots and even GIFs from the game’s combat.</p>
<p>Today we will talk about combat mechanics. Actually, not just talk. We also see some action.</p>
<h2><strong>Turn Based Strategy… with Our Special Sauce</strong></h2>
<p>Angelic utilizes turn-based combat, and we think people who love and know TBS will quickly learn and adapt our game’s combat aspect. That does not mean we just copied the existing dominant TBS mechanics, though. We also implemented some of our special sauce to make it even more tasty!</p>
<p>One of the biggest differences is the drop pods. Unlike the other TBS games, you do not start with a predetermined set of units and play the combat with the same team. Yes you still have a team, but it is up to you who to “deploy” where, and even better, it will be possible for you (and for your opponent) to deploy more heroes even after the combat started.</p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_video et_pb_video_1">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_video_box"><iframe title="Angelic - Captain’s Log Entry #9 - Seliné&#039;s Arrival with Drop Pod" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QIFQKOvMe6Q?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="" style="text-align: center;"><em>– Seliné Vivarri arrives on the battlefield. All heroes have their special drop pods, and these vessels act like personal shuttles with some cool combat features. Each pod has different bonuses and abilities. When the battle is over, heroes will use their pods to leave the field and return to Osiris, the mothership. –</p>
<p></em></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>The combat loop consists of some multiple phases. The first phase is the deployment turn. During that phase, players deploy their hero or heroes wherever they want. Each hero costs some deployment energy, so you cannot unleash your entire roster right ahead.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Then the battle starts. During the battle turn, heroes take turns according to their initiative stat and act. So battle turns consist of multiple hero turns. The important thing is, players do not take turns and move their units. Heroes take turns and move. It is possible that two heroes from your side can move, then one hero from the opponent team can act, and then one from your side and three from the enemy side, etc…</span></p>
<p class=""><span>When all the units act once, the battle turn is over and the next deployment turn begins. That is a unique aspect, because that means the entire combat will be a very dynamic experience, and the tide of the battle can change anytime! So even if you got the upper hand during the combat turn, the enemy can still balance things out by deploying some critical heroes on strategic positions during the next deployment turn.</span></p>
<h2><b>Heroes!</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Another major difference is the heroes and how we design and position them. Angelic is TBS – RPG hybrid as you know, so heroes have personalities, preferences, desires… They are unique. I am not only talking about their looks or characteristics; I am also talking about their “abilities”.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_video et_pb_video_2">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_video_box"><iframe title="Angelic - Captain&#039;s Log #9 - Aurora’s Charged Shot" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x4mEn0733XE?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_5  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="" style="text-align: center;"><em>– A well placed ability can dramatically change the outcome of battles. Aurora’s “Charged Shot” can penetrate everybody on its trajectory (friend or foe, so be careful). Heroes have unique skills, abilities and weapons. Use them masterfully and you can win every kind of encounter no matter the odds! –</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Most of the TBS games feature “soldiers” that are almost identical with each other. Their biggest difference is their weapons. Maybe some minor skill and stat differences… In Angelic, our heroes are massively different from each other. How you use them will dictate the outcome of the battle. A right combination can win the day, while using wrong heroes against wrong opponents can ruin the battle entirely. Strategic thinking is very important, and you must carefully examine the battlefield and the opponents’ units and calculate your next move carefully. Since the game is turn-based, you will have a lot of time to think, no worries.</span></p>
<h2><b>Zone Control</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>So, you can deploy heroes during the deployment turn via drop pods wherever you want, and dramatically change the situation instantly. Does it mean the combat now kind of a random action? On the contrary, that means everything can change all of a sudden so you must control your zone(s) carefully!</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_video et_pb_video_3">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_video_box"><iframe title="Angelic - Captain&#039;s Log #9 - Daeva&#039;s Void Storm" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_iJWM7xBq4?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_7  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="" style="text-align: center;"><em> – Daeva’s Void Storm is a dreadful ability which affects a massive area and can potentially kill multiple enemies on one go. If you are up against heroes who can deal area damage, you should be careful while positioning your heroes. But if you place your heroes too loosely, you might not be able to protect your weaker heroes especially against melee assailants. Decisions… Consequences… –</em></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_8  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Angelic is also a tactical game. Strategy, building a grand plan, is important as I said. Tactics are equally important, because even if you bring the right team against the right opponent, you still have to deploy them carefully and use their skills smartly. Although there will be a progression system for heroes (like upgrading their weapons or levelling up their abilities), upgrades or enhancements cannot make up for bad tactics.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>I know it is quite hard to understand, yet alone feel the combat with just mere words and some short videos. Bad news is, that is all I can offer for this week. Good news is, next week will be big!</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Thank you for reading. Do not forget to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/qvQnCyX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> and hold tight till next week, which will be awesome! </span></p>

			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_9  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Angelic features many significant characters, we have briefly shared the concepts and details of Iset the Mother and Daeva before. Now, it is time to talk about the others a bit.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>This is going to be a quick and brief introduction. Much more information will be shared throughout this month.</span></p>
<p><span>So… Let’s meet the rest of the crew!</span></p>
<h2><b>Odile the Black Swan</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Odile is an infested human lady. When the infestation touches you, it takes only a couple of minutes until it captures your entire body and turns you into something else. This is the main problem with the infestation, it is phenomenally fast.</span></p>
<p><span>Before she got infested, she was a soprano and a ballerina, she lived in one of the outer space human colonies.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_0">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Odile_the_Black_Swan_Angelic-876x1024-1.jpg" alt="" title="Odile_the_Black_Swan_Angelic-876x1024" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_10  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>The thing is, if you are incredibly lucky, you can still control your body and keep your consciousness. You will not be the same person, but you will still be alive. Odile was one of the few lucky people in the universe who  have managed to do that. In fact, there are only a few known cases out of the billions of infected humans. She was remarkably lucky, you could say she won an astronomical lottery.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Odile is also a capable aisar caster. In other words, she is a sorceress as humans call them. She cannot speak, but it is unclear if that was her own decision or due to the infestation changing her. One will usually feel extremely uncomfortable when they meet the eyes with Odile’s, because it is hard to stand against her cold and piercing gaze. If you can bear it, however, you will notice that there is a deep, enigmatic pain and sorrow planted deep inside her looks.</span></p>
<h2><b>Seliné “Nightingale” Vivarri</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Many thought that Seliné’s nickname, Nightingale, comes from her amazingly beautiful voice. The truth is, however, that she is a keen admirer of a great historic figure, Florence Nightingale, who lived during the 19</span><span>th</span><span> Century and considered to be the founding mother of the nursing profession.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_1">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Seline_Vivarri_InGame_Angelic-995x1024-1.jpg" alt="" title="Seline_Vivarri_InGame_Angelic-995x1024" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_11  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Seliné is a second-generation neo-human. She utilizes an enhanced version of a standard female neo-human body, with a cool holographic face projection feature.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Her main profession is being a supermedic. She is an expert doctor, practitioner, engineer and healer and capable of helping humans, eugenics, cybernetics, synths, neo-humans and even infested organisms. There are many supermedics in the ranks of neo-humans; but only Seliné (apart from Iset) can understand and heal physiology and anatomy of the infested.</span></p>
<h2><b>Zarya “Aurora” Mólnija</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>She is one of the two heroes who has human origin. Technically, she is an eugenical (genetically crafted and modified super human) hero.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_2">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aurora_Ingame_Angelic-1024x847-1.jpg" alt="" title="Aurora_Ingame_Angelic-1024x847" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_12  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Eugenical people are both lucky and unlucky; because they have super abilities and talents but they also lack a family and a proper childhood. They are being created, raised and enhanced in eugenics farms and specifically crafted to serve corporations.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Aurora was able to fulfill her duties in 43 years, 7 years before the average service time threshold, as a hunter class tactical operations corporal. Therefore she gained the right of assigning herself a custom name, and after that, she left the service of corporations when she was just 54 years old. Eugenical humans can live hundreds of years and leaving the service of the corporations is considered to be a very risky move; because these people need a continuous and very expensive treatment to sustain their genetically modified bodies. These services sponsored by the corporations, as long as you remain in their service. </span></p>
<p class=""><span>Regardless, she decided to leave the TacOps and joined *you*, her lover. She wanted to start a new life in deep space colonies. She had dreams, ideals…</span></p>
<p class=""><span>You will learn what happens to her next when we launch the game.</span></p>
<h2><b>Rumbrogon</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Rumbrogon is one of the few aliens who is still alive. All known alien civilizations were annihilated by infestations. Somehow Rumbrogon managed to survive and maintain his body’s control even after he got infested.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_3">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Rumbrogon_Ingame_Angelic-1024x870-1.jpg" alt="" title="Rumbrogon_Ingame_Angelic-1024x870" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_13  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span>Daeva found Rumbrogon and Odile long ago, and even she had no idea how they met with each other, why they were together and who they were before the infestation. Iset quickly realized their importance and learned their common past. Yet she did not share all the pieces. Why? Maybe we will learn the reasons later.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Rumbrogon is a warrior class hero. He is a massive, fearless, and terrorizing melee fighter. He wields a giant two-handed sword; and thanks to his unreal regeneration skills (a side benefit of being an infested) he becomes a terrifying force.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Odile is so precious to him; to a point that in the past many times he risked his own life to protect his “queen”. He always follows her, watches her and serves her. Even Daeva was not able to dominate him. Rumbrogon helped Daeva and followed her, but only because Odile was helping Daeva.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Iset the Mother is the second being he respects and listens. It is unclear if that is because Odile also respects Iset, or simply because Rumbrogon admires and fears Iset.</span></p>
<h2><b>Xander Aidan</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Xander is a war veteran and a former stormtrooper of Hoshi Ryū and Celtic Triquetra corporations. He left the Earth when he was just a kid, followed his father and joined the military. For years he fought for the corporations, enhanced his body to be a better soldier and lost many friends. It was a hell of a journey.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Losing friends was devastating enough, but something else drove him off the domestic human space…</span></p>
<p class=""><span> </span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_4">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Xander_Aidan_Angelic-1024x836-1.jpg" alt="" title="Xander_Aidan_Angelic-1024x836" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_14  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>A decade ago, he lost his wife in a very tragic way. She was pregnant and killed brutally by extremist pirates.</span><span> Corporations used that disastrous death for their propaganda. Instead of really helping him to get his revenge, corporations just abused his pain. That is how and when he decided to flee the military service and try his luck in outer space.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>You cannot simply quit the service once you signed a contract with a mega corporation. Xander, however, did just that. Effectively he became a defector and criminal. He spent 3 years escaping from the domestic space, and along the way he met with Aurora and *you*, player.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Xander and Aurora are your dear friends. You all have the same thing in common: you had to escape from your past and left everything behind. You found each other, supported each other, and survived together in the harsh and unforgiving outer space theater.</span> </p>
<p class=""><span>But who are you? What is your name? Your appearance, past, story… So far we reviewed Iset the Mother, Daeva, Odile, Aurora, Rumbrogon, Seliné and Xander. There is one more major character left: You.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Later…</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Thank you for reading and please join our <a href="https://discord.gg/qvQnCyX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>, as well.</span></p>
<p><span>Next week we might have a surprise for you guys, stay tuned!</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Welcome to another weekly developer diary post! So far, we discussed the reason why we started this project, and how we managed to do it. We also talked about the ship we will command (Osiris) and some important aspects regarding the companions, or heroes as we call them. During the last two weeks, we briefly visited the massive lore of Angelic, learned some details about major historical events.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>We talked about a lot of things, but we never discussed the future.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>How do we plan to proceed until Kickstarter? What would be the next steps for the project? If you are wondering the answers of these questions, this diary entry is for you.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Narrative Trailer</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>We have promised you a narrative trailer, and we deliver you one. Soon.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>It is already finished, but we are waiting for something else in order to release the trailer. We want a powerful reveal event, so instead of releasing key materials one by one, we will launch most of them together. For that reason, the narrative trailer will have to wait a little longer.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>However, do not worry. I believe you’re going to like what you are about to see. We are working really hard to deliver you quality content, the narrative trailer is no exception. A lot of people worked like crazy to create something exciting. It is a pain for us to hold it back for some more time, believe me. We are all looking forward to releasing it as soon as possible, but our PR and marketing strategies dictate that we wait.</span></p>
<h2><b>Gameplay Reveal</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Gameplay content, or at least a single screenshot from the game was number one demand from you and we are all aware of that. However, once again, our obsession with quality holds us back. We have something really promising and beautiful at the moment. Still, we do not want to publish anything from the game before we polish the content to a level which we would all feel content.</span></p>
<p><span>In August, however, I can say that we will start releasing gameplay-related materials, footage, and screenshots. Of course, there is always a risk of delay, but at the moment it is our plan.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><strong>Kickstarter Date</strong></h2>
<p>As you know, we were getting ready for the Kickstarter campaign, and we were targeting September 2020 from the beginning to initiate the campaign. That does not mean we will launch the game on that date. Please do not confuse them.</p>
<p>Also please note that September is a tentative date for the campaign. It might slip. Quality is super important for us, so if we need more time, we might delay the date a bit. Of course, if we do that, we will let you know, and we will do our best to not delay the date.</p>
<p>Unless we encounter a major setback or problem, I think we will catch our tentative deadline. Moreover, we should be able to release some cool in-game content next month. August will be hot people, get ready!</p>
<p>Thank you for your support so far. Please support us by spreading the word and inviting your friends to our website and Discord server</p>
<p>Thanks and see you next week</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Hope is a Dangerous Thing</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Project Transcendence was a declaration of open war against all of the corporations. This world’s system is based on a “professional slavery,” and even the possibility of elevating random people towards the top of the pyramid, with unseen talents, amazing intellectual capabilities and potentially immortal bodies was a cardinal sin in the eyes of the mega corporations.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Only 24 hours after the project’s announcement, The Supreme Cartel, a union of the mega corporations which practically acted as a form of global government, gave a warning to Angelicon. However, it was an expected reaction, and Angelicon had no desire to fight against the big guys. At least, not yet.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>They played smart. With tons of political maneuvers and some compromises, The Supreme Cartel gave the greenlight for the project. However, the decision of who was going to transcend into a neo-human is now in the hands of the cartel executives and the project quickly became the elite’s path to immortality.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>While explaining the reason why they decided to limit the program’s reach, The Supreme Arbiter of the cartel summarized that </span><i><span>“…hope is a dangerous thing. Give too less to the masses, they become unstable. Give too much, they become dangerous. And you are giving it way too much, gentleman.</span></i><span>”</span></p>
<h2><b>They are the Forsaken Ones!</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Within less than a year, complications began to arise. Neo-humans, also known as “the angels”, started to show signs of serious psychological problems. More and more of them wanted to go back to their human forms over time, which was impossible. When some high-profile neo-humans committed suicide or completely lost it and started to act wildly, the Supreme Cartel decided to pause the program and authorized seven inspectors to investigate what was going on.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>They found that the safest way of transcending into a neo-human had an extremely high personal cost: One must accept to erase his or her memories; at least, most of them. The rich did not want to lose their path to immortality, so they accepted the solution offered by Angelicon executives and their scientists: an expansion of the program.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Years later, the Supreme Cartel would realize that it was a trap. Initially, though, it was perceived as a great solution to save the program. It was simply about opening the program to the masses. To “the forsaken ones”, as one global media company famously described. The real intention was to use people as test subjects, until a proper fix was found for the dreadful psychological side effects of the transcendence.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>The hidden reason; however, was something else. Angelicon knew from the beginning that to properly transcend, the candidate’s memories must be almost entirely wiped out. From day one, they also knew there was no fix. The entire promise of the expansion program was a lie. They were not after a way to find a transfer of a human being into an angel with his or her full memories. They were after a revolution.</span></p>
<h2><b>Interhuman Wars</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Thousands of people volunteered, they had nothing to lose. Almost an immortal body, infinite life and god like powers were promised. It was a good deal. In fact, it was a “too good to be true” kind of a deal.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Years have passed without any notable development on the fix; but something else was attracting attention: Neo-humans’ amazing capabilities and speed at developing technologies. They have encyclopedic memories and superb intellectual skills. They never tire, do not require to sleep, or eat, do not have any kind of emotional instability issues. They have an amazing efficiency. While Angelicon’s share value was skyrocketing, all the big corporations found themselves competing to grab more technologies and privileges from the creators of the angels. Within a decade, neo-humans silently grabbed most of the strategic positions within the corporations and replaced a lot of the workforce.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>For the ordinary people, Angelicon became the ultimate enemy. Neo-humans were threatening their jobs and future. Yet a lot of people were still trying to transcend, because they knew there was no feasible way to stop that revolution. A lot of people were planning to destroy the company, on the other hand. However, Angelicon has an impenetrable shield. It was a very unexpected ally’s protection: The Supreme Cartel’s member corporations.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Why? Because now they all depend on Angelicon’s technology. They both envy them and admire them. They all know the potential danger yet cannot unify and try to digest Angelicon because they did not trust each other. At least Angelicon had no direct military division or army. They were no threat.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>That assumption proved to be the greatest mistake humankind ever made.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="" style="text-align: center;"><em>– Concept art of Daeva. Daeva was the first rebel and rallied thousands of neo-humans against the Cartel. Practically she ignited the interhuman war with her rebellion. However history records show Iset’s refusal of helping corporations against the rebel angels as the real beginning of the great war. –</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_24  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>In 2522, the first rebel neo-human reported. She refused to continue working for Hoshi Ryū, a giant corporation headquartered in former Japan. Dozens of neo-humans followed her rebellion and wanted to break free from the chains of corporations. All have been eliminated brutally.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Rebellions spread, however, in the following months. Celtic Triquetra, Lilac Crocus, Red Syndicate and Asteria were among the heavily affected mega corporations. Despite the global media’s efforts, neo-humans managed to leak tons of information about the corporation’s shady dealings and unfair treatments to their employees, human and neo-human alike. A global revolt began.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>In 2524 The Supreme Cartel declared neo-humans “illegal”, effectively marking them for mass execution. Angelicon strongly protested that decision, and as a result their membership status was stalled by the Cartel.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Many people believed that Angelicon was secretly helping the rebel angels, and in 2526 the Cartel decided to cancel the trade license of the company, which practically means war against it. However, it quickly became clear that even Angelicon has lost their control over neo-humans.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>The question was, who was leading them then?</strong></p>
<p class=""><span>Daeva, a secret neo-human prototype, who was engineered by Iset herself without the knowledge of the Cartel, but with the blessing of Angelicon top executives, revealed herself in 2527 before she blew up the Celtic Triquetra’s multi-million bitcoin worth space station.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>It was the grandest space station of humankind. It was the day when the interhuman war began globally. Yet not the entire neo-human population was actively fighting against the corporations. Hundreds of millions of humans were also rioting against the companies, as well. So the Cartel was not up against the rebel angels only. They were also busy with restless “forsaken ones”.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>War escalated quickly. Rebel angels kept hacking corporations’ data and they managed to create a global chaos. In 7</span><span>th</span><span> of July 2527, Iset, the very first neo-human ever created, decided to join the rebellion by refusing the help request coming from Angelicon company itself. Her decision marked the official beginning of the interhuman war; because millions of neo-humans also joined the rebellion afterwards and days later all the corporations united against them.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Now called as the “fallen angels”, neo-humans shifted their strategies and instead of playing defensive with some guerrilla tactics, under Iset’s leadership, they started to act offensively. Within weeks the Cartel found itself defending its own bases and assets. The second wave led by Iset proved to be a massive force with unforeseen technologies and new “arch-angels”. Apart from Daeva, who was revealed herself before, they realized that Iset has created a lot of super advanced neo-humans.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Atum the Mysterious led the offensive against Lilac Crocus. Kayra and Andraste (the Chaos twins) were fighting against Angelicon. Sigrun and Siegfried AKA Valkyries, along with Eir the Merciful, Minerva the Owl, and Lywen the Red (Crimson Angels) united against Asteria and Red Syndicate. Badb, Macha and Annand, collectively called the Phantom Crows, were giving hell to Hoshi Ryū. They have three things in common. They were listening to Iset, they were all using mythological and historical names, and they came out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>In 2528, within seven months, fallen angels literally devastated the corporations. The Supreme Cartel asked for unconditional surrender. For days, they did not receive any reply. It was the day the world stood still.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Then, mysteriously, angels started to retreat. Nobody understood what was happening. In two weeks they all gone.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>The abrupt end of the interhuman war was a turning point for humanity. What happened after the war? How has human society evolved? What was the fate of the Cartel and mega corporations? Why did the neo-humans decide to retreat and what happened to them?</span></p>
<p class=""><span>We will discuss these topics later.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>While the Giants are Battling…</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>I wanted to write a different developer diary this time and share a piece of the story with you. We will keep focusing on the narrative side of the game in this article and in the next one.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>We are quite close to releasing our narrative trailer, yet we cannot relay all the details of our lore and story with a single movie, of course. Consider this diary post as a predecessor of the upcoming trailer.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>So far, we know that the future is quite dark and Earth is mostly a barren place now. Overpopulation and industrialization caused an irreversible climate crisis. To make things worse, humanity suffered three nuclear wars. From the ashes of the old world, the era of the corporations rose. People are no longer citizens of governments, but employees of companies. There are a lot of “undercities” and “deepcities”, meaning cities under the ground or deep in the ocean; all because of the massive radiation on the ground. Limited “clean” territories all belong to the rich and elite. Some corporations host even sky cities, floating massive structures.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>What about the others? Unless you are a high-level manager or engineer; or a relative to a big corporation’s shareholder, life is quite hard for you. Many call these people “the forsaken”.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Angelicon was a very marginal company, indeed. Founders of the company made a fortune during the second global nuclear crisis; known as the second doomsday wars, by aggressively buying the stocks of banks, transportation, energy, and entertainment companies. Right after the cease-fire period, prices of these stocks skyrocketed, and the founders became trillionaires. Quickly they started up Angelicon, a robotics, pharmaceutical, and genetics company. Just before the third nuclear war, they got hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of contracts from mega-corporations and announced a next-gen synth soldier project.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>The third war declared but thanks to Angelicon’s rapid progress on such spectacular technologies, did not continue for a long time. Already exhausted, Lilac Crocus and Celtic Triquetra accepted to surrender, and the world was saved from ultimate annihilation. Angelicon became a hero for many, although they were still relatively small, they got incredibly famous fast.</span></p>
<p><span>Their neutral stance against the big guys was not to last, however. Ambitions were about to clash.</span></p>
<h2><b>“Project Transcendence”</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Angelicon’s rise towards the top tier of the unforgiving pyramid of corporations was just beginning. They had managed to stay neutral for decades and even when they must pick sides, they were at least sympathetic in the eyes of the opponents.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>It all changed when they declared an overly ambitious project: Transcendence.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>All of a sudden, they became a threat to all big corporations, cartels, syndicates, and trusts.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>We will continue our journey on the backstory of the game next week.

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>What is better than exploring the universe, traveling between planets, space stations, and colonies while pursuing adventures in a state-of-art spaceship?</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Doing all these actions with charismatic, unique, and deep characters, of course!</span></p>
<p class=""><span>The journey you are about to embark on will require a lot of help, anyway.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Here at Metaverse Studios, we believe one of the most important features of Angelic will be the companions, or heroes, you meet throughout your adventure. They can be your friends, lovers, enemies… Or simply be indifferent towards you. Regardless of their view of you, they will always be significant.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Angelic is not a game where the entire fate of the universe falls into your hands. Absolutely not. That is the most senseless, unreasonable, and unrealistic cliché you can imagine.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>However, you can still have a solid impact on many lives: Save them, doom them or ignore them. You can achieve great things or fail miserably. But whatever you are planning to do, know that you cannot achieve what you desire all by yourself. You will need help, like it or not.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>You will need allies.</span></p>
<h2><b>Not an Easy Alliance</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Maybe you are disappointed when I say, “the ultimate fate of the universe will not fall into your hands” and you will need allies.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Get ready for more bad news. Because those potential allies might have different agendas, motivations, and desires. Just because you want them to assist you does not mean they will start following you.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>The game has some surprises in store for you, but of course, I cannot give spoilers here. All I can say is, from time to time you will have to work with characters that you hate, and even worse, you will have to make a team out of a group of people who literally hate each other. Good luck with that.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>If you can gain their respect and trust, however, you will assemble a fearsome force. You can learn more secrets from the universe of the game, unlock more content, and optimize your gameplay experience to the max.</span></p></div>

However, it will not be possible to modify a hero to a point that they might become unrecognizable or lose their identical characteristics.

You will have neo-human, genetically modified, cybernetic, and infested companions. They will be living on the same ship. Talking with each other, sometimes fighting with each other. One of your responsibilities will be to make sure that they will not kill each other and focus their anger towards your opponents.</span></p>
<h2><b>Angelic is Also a Strategy Game, Afterall…</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Apart from narrative-wise functions, heroes have also a massive impact on gameplay.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>You will have to master your skills on how to utilize their strong points and benefit from their skills optimally to overcome various encounters the game will throw your way.</span></p></div>

There are many different “classes” of heroes; for instance, you will have assassin, hunter, healer, tank, and melee heroes. You will even have “sorcerers” as the old ones (humans) name them. For humans, anything that they cannot comprehend is called magic. In truth, there are no sorcerers. Just “aisars” and “atronics”. These roles will be discussed later.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>As a final note, let me underline that unlike other turn-based-strategy games, units in our game are not just soldiers with different weapons. This is a major difference in terms of gameplay. They are completely different from each other. They have unique skills, different advantages and disadvantages and they use distinct weapons. We have other cool features like drop pod mechanics, combo effects, and functional customizations.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Do not worry, we will show you what we are talking about in great detail soon.</span> </p>

				</div>
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_34  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Angelic has two main layers: Combat sequences (action) and Ship sequences (role-playing).</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Today, we delve deep into the ship and its design. It is important to discuss the ship because it is home to our own character, which has not been revealed yet, as well as your companions.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>I have mentioned Angelic is a narrative turn-based strategy RPG and underlined the importance of our companions. Gameplay-wise, we call them “heroes”. Narrative-wise, they are your companions. In the next diary entry, we will talk about your companions’ roles and functions, and in this entry we will focus on your “home” in the world of Angelic.</span></p>
<p><span>Osiris, a one-of-a-kind neo-human mothership, is your home. Although we categorize the ship as a mothership, Osiris is quite small compared to other similar ships. Just because Osiris is small compared to other motherships doesn’t mean it is actually small, though; it is still a massive, awe-inspiring, ship to command.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Its most important feature is, however, something incredibly significant: Osiris is the ship of Iset the Mother. In other words, it is a ship that belongs to a goddess.</span></p>
<h2><b>Commanding a Goddess Ship</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Many revere Iset (also known as Isis) as a goddess because of her immense power and technological advancements. Like all neo-humans, she was once a human. After hundreds of years after her transcendence to neo-human form, her wisdom, technology, and capabilities have advanced beyond comprehension. She is called “the mother” because she has created a lot of neo-humans so far, most of them are significant characters.</span></p>
<p><span>Good news for you, you are commanding her personal ship: Osiris. You might ask why and how… I am afraid you will have to wait a little longer to explore the answers to these questions.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Let me continue with the ship’s design: We knew from day one that Osiris must be a sleek, elegant, and ultra-techy vessel. At the same time, the ship must inherit some design elements from Iset, its master and engineer.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_13">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Angelic_Mothership-Sketches-1-1024x576-1.png" alt="" title="Angelic_Mothership-Sketches-1-1024x576" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_35  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p style="text-align: center;"><em>– Early sketches of Osiris. You might want to explore the form as a first step. So we were playing with some silhouette designs to find the appropriate form for the ship. –</em><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: left;"> </span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_14">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Angelic_Mothership-Sketches-2-1024x576-1.png" alt="" title="Angelic_Mothership-Sketches-2-1024x576" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_36  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p style="text-align: center;"><em>– We quickly realized we hit the sweet spot with the 9th and 10th variations. So decided to focus on these forms, thus the second phase of the conceptualization work began. –</em><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: left;"> </span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_37  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Once the form is selected, we were ready for details. Picking colors, deciding about the texture… Apart from the silhouette, we were also constantly looking for unique design elements to make the ship even more spectacular and distinctive.</span></p>
<p><span>Then Emre Aktuna, our concept designer, came up with a brilliant idea: Wing tails!</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_15">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Angelic_Osiris-Wing-Tails-1024x576-1.png" alt="" title="Angelic_Osiris-Wing-Tails-1024x576" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_38  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p style="text-align: center;"><em>– These wing tails would enhance the ship’s unique essence, as well as serve as a cool design element and visual effects material. We all fell in love with the idea, and the only problem was achieving this in-engine in real time. –</em><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: left;"> </span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_39  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Lord of Dead and Rebirth</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>We realized we still did not pick a name to the ship on that point. I spent some time to find a proper one, but once I came up with the name of Osiris, everybody liked that name. Why? Its metaphorical meaning was cool and appropriate, and its mythological relevance with Iset (Isis) was quite fitting.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Osiris has a lot of compartments. We only are able to show you the command information center, or CIC in short, during the Kickstarter campaign. Depending on our speed, we want to show you its massive corridor as well. That corridor is a hallway that leads different rooms such as your companions’ private quarters, core room, ship’s very own bar, prison, lab, docks, etc.…</span><span> </span></p>
<p class=""><span>Each compartment of Osiris is significant. Companions’ own quarters are their homes, each one of them will be different and unique, and will present tons of role-playing options.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_16">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Angelic_Osiris-Front-and-Back-1024x576-1.png" alt="" title="Angelic_Osiris-Front-and-Back-1024x576" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_40  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Ship’s bar is also a cool place to kill some time, but also an important area to enhance your relationships with your heroes, sometimes heal some wounds, and of course mostly for fun. Also, I am trying to be incredibly careful here not to give any early spoilers but, our bar will have awesome music…</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Prison, lab, docks, and core room will also present additional functionalities. However, we do not want to overpromise anything, so all these rooms and mentioned features depend on our budget. Hero quarters and the bar (it even has a cool name: The Pit) have the priority.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>I will be discussing some of these rooms in more detail later, especially the bar and hero quarters. Also, we spend some time on heroes (companions) and how they play a significant role in this game. This is just a beginning to our journey to the gameplay and the narrative side of the project.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>To conclude this diary entry, I want to briefly talk about our goal with Osiris. Commanding a cool spaceship and venturing forth into the vast, dark, and frightening, yet curious deep space was always my dream. It is obvious that I cannot personally experience this in my lifetime. At least, though, thanks to Angelic, we can enjoy a similar experience virtually.</span></p>
<p><span>Even the possibility of wandering inside my ship, enjoying small and smart design details of its architecture, looking to the infinite blackness of the space through the glass corridors of the ship, and drinking with my friends after a challenging mission is so thrilling. So inspiring.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Yes, inspiring. I think that is a perfect keyword for Osiris. That is what we are trying to achieve. I hope you also admire what we are doing here, already inspired by the game, and will support us to achieve our dreams.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Or shall I say, *our* dreams?</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Unlike the common belief, the universe is not a deterministic, organized system. Sorry to disappoint you, but the universe is full of chaos. Even worse, according to the second law of thermodynamics, we have the law of entropy, which dictates the existing chaotic order gets even worse continuously.</p>
<p>It might be a surprise for some of you, but if you live in Turkey like me, or if you try to be an entrepreneur in Turkey, you would not argue that Turkey is a chaotic place. We are playing the game in über-hardcore mode all the time. So, when the world literally stood still during the Covid-19 outbreak, we Turkish entrepreneurs are like “…just another crisis, it will also pass…”</p>
<p>When things got bad for even Turkish standards, everybody starting to close their companies, halting their investments, and literally going into hiding, I realized a golden opportunity had arisen for me. I decided to go all in.</p>
<p>In 2009, when the world was hit by the mortgage crisis, my first game company (Céidot Game Studios) almost went bankrupt. In 2013, we had massive political turmoil in Turkey, which also affected the economy and all my investor talks collapsed. In 2016, we suffered at the hands of an attempted military coup in Turkey; that was the killer blow for the first attempt of Metaverse.</p>
<p>And this year… Covid-19 caused an unprecedented, catastrophic crisis and the second attempt of founding Metaverse had collapsed again.</p>
<p>One week later we decided to kill the initiative. I realized that I was doing something wrong. Very wrong.</p>
<p>I must say, because I am also a trader, I had to master the skill of controlling my emotions. Furthermore, I learned the value of thinking differently than the herd, seeing opportunities when everybody is terrified. In the 18th century, Baron Rothschild said “buy when there’s blood in the streets”. Believe me, it is a powerful strategy if you have some solid nerves. Remembering my trading lessons also helped me to identify the mistake I was making.</p>
<p>Recalling that my greatest achievements happened when I acted boldly and kept going no matter what happens helped me pinpoint the problem, as well. The final motivation came from a very unexpected source, however.</p>
<p>Suddenly, YouTube suggested this video to me:</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_video_box"><iframe title="The Dark Knight Rises - Prison Escape [HD SCENE]" width="1080" height="810" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DjffIi2Pl7M?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><strong>Ride the Storm!</strong></p>
<p>On that day I recalled a lost talent of mine: Ability to ride the storms!</p>
<p>I was trying to play safe, way too much. I knew Angelic was a solid project. I trusted the idea and my skills. I knew people would start to follow me once I set myself on the road. However, I kept looking for additional safety measures.</p>
<p>Fear is a perfect motivational source. If you use it properly, it is a significant ally. It is the only power that keeps you smart, agile, disciplined, and focused all the time. In order to achieve the bold goals of Angelic, I had to fear.</p>
<p>I was once a storm rider. I knew the secrets of riding that dark, yet wildly beautiful chaotic tempest. You need to sync yourself up with its dreadful swings. Sometimes you need to gently push it, sometimes you need to obey it. Mostly you need to think fast and rarely you will have second chances. So yes, it is a risky business. Riding storms…</p>
<p>And to succeed, first and foremost, you need to cut the rope.</p></div>

<p class=""><span>A lot of people have asked us about our budget. Some of my friends even thought that I have a secret investor and possibly moved forward with a million-dollar budget or something.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Let me tell you what our budget is.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>No, it is not a million-dollar bu</span>dget. It is not even one hundred thousand dollars budget. Nowhere near. I am not going to tell you what our budget is really, you would not believe it.</p>
<p class=""><span>Let me tell you this; however, our real budget, or real “fuel of motivation” is something much more significant. More valuable than a million-dollar bank account.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>It is our </span><b>dedication</b><span>. Our </span><b>motivation</b><span>. Yep, just that.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Our real budget is our hunger for success. Our desire to achieve our goals. Believe me, when we are done with Kickstarter, or right after we launch the Kickstarter campaign, I will honestly announce our real budget. And you will not believe it.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Before concluding the diary I want to underline that the greatest value of this project is its team. I absolutely owe my team everything. With your permission, I want to thank all my team members, every single one of them, for their amazing support. Know that all our developers and artists are sacrificing a lot of things to make this dream happen and that is precisely why we will succeed. We are not developing this game with a solid budget perhaps. We have something much more valuable. We are developing it with our hearts, and hearts do not require money to pump blood. They require dreams and ideals.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>So, it is time to ride the storm once again. Time to ascend… without the rope.</span></p>

<p class="">
<p class=""><span>That simple question forces us to check our motivations. Our reasoning, target, aim… I had to think hard about some solid answers for this deceptively easy, but devilishly hard question. I knew from the beginning that the answer must be powerful, otherwise I should not be investing my life, my dreams, and my hopes into this project.</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><strong>“I have a dream”</strong></h2>
<p>We are developing Angelic because it is our dream. It is our passion.</p>
<p>We know chasing dreams can be a double-edged sword, it presents an immense power, but when left unchecked it can lead you to your doom. So we did our homework, checked the market, saw an opportunity, came up with a plan, and now we are following a reasonable strategy to establish a solid foundation for our product business-wise.</p>
<p>We love the turn-based strategy genre and there are many superb titles out there. However, in our opinion, they lack one thing: a deep, rich narrative layer and solid lore backing it up. How many of you remember characters from X-Com or HoMM series?</p>
<p>That is why we define our game as an RPG/TBS hybrid. We have inherited a lot of mechanics from RPGs, added deep lore, a solid story, and plenty of multi-layered characters. You will care for your heroes, pay attention to what they think about you, what would they want… You will feel their pain and joy. They are not generic cannon fodder or damage dealers; they are your allies and friends.</p>
<p>Does it mean we mostly focus on the RPG elements of the game? Well, we are spending A LOT of time to design characters, but we spent an equal amount of time to make a unique, yet recognizable turn-based battle system for you all to enjoy. Each character you have will bring a unique set of skills and abilities to the battleground, and coupled with our combat mechanics, the battle experience will be both challenging and satisfying.</p>
<p>Let me stop on that subject for now, we will be discussing all these details along the way in future developer diaries. I want to give an ultimate, final answer on why we are making this game:</p>
<p>Angelic is a beautiful game. We know when we finish it, it will be something we will be proud of. It is something we will tell our friends as one of our life’s crowning achievements. In truth, that is all that matters. We all live to write our own stories. We could have chosen the easy path, you know, pumping hypercasual games and such, make relatively easy money… But no, we chose the difficult way. We want something more permanent, inspiring, and glorious. We wanted a real story.</p>
<p>I do not know how the story of Angelic will conclude. Maybe a failure? Or an epic success. Is it really important? I am sure, though, that it will be an amazing bedtime story for our grandchildren, a narrative about how we embarked a great adventure, how we struggled, how we stood against all odds and bravely fought for our dreams.</p>
<p>That is all that matters. Fighting for your dreams.</p>
