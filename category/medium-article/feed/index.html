The short answer is: Angelic is a narrative single/multiplayer strategy RPG backed by the blockchain and set in a collaborative sci-fi metaverse.</p>
<p id="c4c7" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Great. What does that mean?</p></div>

<p id="eb10" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is for fans of single-player games where you join a massive conflict and will have to question the morality of humanity, and struggle to make the right decision most of the time in the dark sci-fi universe of Angelic.</p>
<p id="8725" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is for fans of multiplayer games where you build guilds, form alliances, and make an impact on the deep space colonies by your actions.</p>
<p id="23fe" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is for fans of the power of blockchain and the metaverse. People who enjoy crafting NFTs that can be used, earned, traded, and more.</p>
<p id="ab65" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is for people who like to play and earn, not just play to earn.</p>
<p id="2655" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is for people who would like to have a say in how their game develops and even love to contribute to the design of the IP.</p>
<p id="e431" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is the future of gaming and we’ve got the team to back it up.</p>

<p id="6a06" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’ve already explained that Angelic is a game with many facets. Everything is built around the lore of a dark and compelling universe. You find yourself in the future taking on the persona of Phoenix, a prototype neo-human raised from death by Iset the Mother for reasons known only to her.</p>
<p id="4abc" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">A fungal plague is rapidly encroaching on inhabited worlds, corporations are at each other’s throats, and the return of neo-humans is not helping. Or perhaps the return of Iset is exactly what humanity needs to survive.</p>
<p id="f1b1" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jp">Single-Player Mode</strong></p>
<p id="1da2" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">In single-player mode you take your place in a massive conflict, commanding a one-of-a-kind spaceship that reveals its secrets and capabilities to you as you progress through the story. You’ll run missions with companions that you meet along the way. Your companions have their own unique motivations, desires, and beliefs. Part of your job will be to balance their needs against yours and their skills against the missions you take them on. The more you progress through the story the better you’ll understand your allies and forge a team to change the course of the war.</p>
<p id="846b" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">You’re able to customize your companions, craft unique items (even ships), and progress through skill trees with a wide array of abilities and skills. Your experience will be unique to you, based on the decisions you make in the game.</p>
<p id="e6ff" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">While your single-player avatar and heroes will be different than those in multiplayer mode you’ll still gain benefits in multiplayer mode from your activities in the solo game.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p id="5eba" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jp">Multiplayer Mode</strong></p>
<p id="1e8d" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic also offers a massively multiplayer gaming experience, though we do suggest you finish the single-player campaign before joining the larger metaverse (but that’s up to you. You can jump straight into multiplayer mode if you prefer)</p>
<p id="9baa" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">In Multiplayer mode you’ll create your custom avatar and join one of many neo-human alliances, each with its own requirements, agendas, and idiosyncrasies. Choose from:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="fee9" class="jr js he cg b id ie ih ii il jt ip ju it jv ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Prodigies — science-based and elite.</li>
<li id="e670" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Chaos Symphony — Order is an illusion, Chaos is the real force behind all things.</li>
<li id="6bfc" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Sky Legion — Mercenaries with a code, and a plan.</li>
<li id="0161" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Crimson Angels — Healers with a mission to save their founder.</li>
<li id="2370" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Phantom Crows — Shadows in the universe, little is known about them, perhaps you’ll be the first.</li>
<li id="b905" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Unbound — Unaffiliated, unconcerned with the goings on of the galaxy…probably.</li>
</ul>
<p id="bc26" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Players can also form their own guilds, each governed by their own separate DAO entity. Guilds can decide how to expand, which planets to colonize, and even build their own space stations. Guilds generate revenues from their activities and investments and that revenue is divided amongst the players making them much more than a simple social organization.</p>
<p id="7e49" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">In Multiplayer mode the Sol System is dominated by the corporations, but you have free rein to shape the deeper regions of space through your actions.</p>
<p id="e00b" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Additionally, you’ll find many multiplayer missions, co-op battles, and even guild wars. You can join or watch from afar, again the choices are yours. There’s even a PVP option with real rewards and losses on the line.</p>
<p id="70e5" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jp">Character Progression</strong></p>
<p id="45a8" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">As your heroes and avatar gain experience from combat, missions, mega-construction projects, or community events you’ll be able to unlock new abilities and features for your character. Each hero has a different skill tree allowing you to create a custom lineup for your team. Abilities can work together and you may find some powerful combinations that you didn’t expect.</p>
<p id="2446" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">You’ll also be able to customize your ships. At this time there are four ship types:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="fbc9" class="jr js he cg b id ie ih ii il jt ip ju it jv ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">CARRIERS: Expand your team size.</li>
<li id="d3e6" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">DROPSHIPS: Required for special missions such as infiltration and stealth operations, which you cannot participate with a carrier class ship.</li>
<li id="14a7" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">FIGHTER DRONES: Fully autonomous battleships. Size and capabilities vary. Required to protect your colonies, space stations, starbases, etc…</li>
<li id="7029" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">MINING DRONES: Autonomous mining drones, necessary for space mining operations (except on-site mining actions)</li>
</ul>
<p id="2c5b" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jp">Crafting</strong></p>
<p id="01ac" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’ll be releasing another article on crafting soon, but for the moment let&#8217;s just talk about the fact that not only can you craft unique items, you can craft unique NFT heroes which you can then rent or sell to other players in the game! Crafting is an important part of your story progression and you’ll even be able to craft unique ships!</p>
<p id="b3b6" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Crafting also allows you to upgrade your gadgets to suit the needs of the missions ahead of you!</p>
<p id="686a" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Crafting falls into five categories:</p>
<p id="e642" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Item crafting: To include weapons, armor, hero skins, accessories, and more.</p>
<p id="a1f9" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Meta estates: Create your own version of a home in the Angelic Metaverse, you can rent or sell these as you see fit.</p>
<p id="f945" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Heroes: Technically you’re not crafting the hero so much as training them up for your missions (or to sell to other players)</p>
<p id="97d7" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Vehicles: Find the blueprints, components, and resources and you can create, buy, or rent ships from others in the Metaverse!</p>
<p id="5b07" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Colonization and Mega-Projects: In conjunction with other players you can undertake the task of creating starbases, wonder projects (landmarks), and even colonizing planets!</p>
<p id="45bb" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">There’s a lot more to unpack so keep your eyes peeled for the deep dive into crafting!</p></div>

<p id="59bb" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Here’s another topic that should (and will) be an article in and of itself. We’re leaning into the ability of blockchain technology to allow our players to actually contribute to the development of the game by way of the Council of Angels.</p>
<p id="0759" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Players holding $ANGL coin will be able to vote on the direction of the game, connect with developers, and truly impact the future of the game that they love. The Council of Angels will be the player governing body, taking feedback from the community and putting into action and allowing us to better understand what you want as the universe expands.</p>
<p id="d534" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jp">Whew, that was a lot to cover in one go.</strong></p>
<p id="e46e" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’re posting articles twice a week to give updates, explain details of the game, and dive further into every aspect of the game. Coming soon will be more detail on crafting, blockchain, and NFTs in gaming, character/hero profiles, and more. If there’s something you specifically want to know more about it, find us on social media and let us know! In the meantime, there’s more information about everything we discussed today on our<span> </span>website.</p>
<p id="8f13" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We look forward to sharing more and connecting with you, here or in the metaverse!</p></div>

We already have an early stage playable demo with over 3 hours of gameplay!</p>
<p id="39a7" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jj">What Is Angelic?</strong></p>
<p id="2865" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Set in a dark science fiction universe, Angelic is a compelling narrative RPG that puts the players in the driver’s seat as they explore and even shape the worlds they’re playing in (more on this in just a moment).</p>
<p id="d21f" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">By combining the best of online gaming, RPGs, turn-based strategy, and distinctive, colorful heroes in a player-driven universe, Angelic really is the first game of its kind.</p>
<p id="68e2" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">With equal emphasis on storytelling and party-based RPG elements, Angelic players are drawn into a dark and compelling science fiction setting. Mesmerizing stories unfold as players progress through a complex universe where motivations may not always be clear, and where allies can be the key to success…or disaster.</p>
<p id="eb96" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic will be one of the first playable AA+ releases, and our three-hour demo has already been gaining rave reviews and will be available for limited beta play in the coming months.</p>
<p id="c213" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="jl">“I’ve never seen anything quite like this, and I love the direction it’s taking.” Holly S.</em></p>
<p id="639a" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jj">Why Blockchain?</strong></p>
<p id="8ad7" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Players are connected in the Metaverse, able to share content with each other, interact, and even influence the development of the game by becoming members of the player Council, voting on development decisions, providing direction, and partaking in the success of the community as a whole.</p>
<p id="6b45" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Unfortunately, most gaming companies build closed worlds without real digital items, which means:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="5340" class="jm jn he cg b io ip is it iw jo ja jp je jq ji jr js jt ju fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Players can only rent short-term entertainment value</li>
<li id="9553" class="jm jn he cg b io jv is jw iw jx ja jy je jz ji jr js jt ju fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Players cannot be adequately rewarded for their activities</li>
<li id="13e6" class="jm jn he cg b io jv is jw iw jx ja jy je jz ji jr js jt ju fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Players cannot build long-term, scalable businesses</li>
<li id="ae67" class="jm jn he cg b io jv is jw iw jx ja jy je jz ji jr js jt ju fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Players hold no rights to speak in the game or influence the game’s future</li>
<li id="2361" class="jm jn he cg b io jv is jw iw jx ja jy je jz ji jr js jt ju fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">The stories in the games don’t allow for choice; players MUST do whatever the developers decide</li>
</ul>
<p id="886c" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We don’t like any of that.</p>
<p id="63a4" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="jl">“We HAVE to build this universe together with our players. This is the future of gaming.” Erkan Bayol — Metaverse Game Studios, CEO</em></p>
<p id="ecf7" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">With a strong vision in mind to make this a truly collaborative gaming experience, our team has built the game with player control and even player ownership in mind. This means finding the right blockchain ecosystem to build on in a way that allows for a Player First mentality, infinite scalability, and social/eco responsibility.</p>
<p id="346f" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’ve decided to build on the Solana blockchain because it fits all of our requirements; not only is it incredibly stable and growing, it’s eco-friendly, and the community of developers around it means as the Metaverse grows, so will Angelic, as will the value we bring our players.</p>
<p id="7716" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">This all allows Angelic to feature a collaborative development between the developers and you, our fans. United we build and expand this universe to be unlike anything that has come before.</p>
<p id="d2b1" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Backed and powered by the blockchain, you can create cosmetic items, ships, and hero NFTs to use in the game or trade with fellow players and collectors. Better yet, thanks to our DAO mechanism, our community will have significant governance over the game AND the IP as it expands to suit the vision of the most important stakeholders, the players.</p>
<p id="664d" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Have fun, play how you want, enjoy the benefits of the community, and own the future of gaming.</p>

Those same corporations have dominated the Earth unopposed for centuries and are now dealing with a fungal plague absorbing and destroying their deep-space colonies, and the return of neo-humans sends the corporations over the edge and chaos ensues.</p>

<p id="3f8d" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic plans to release our first vertical slice in early 2022 which allows players to experience new content, track progress, and provide feedback in both single-player and multiplayer mode. Players can start crafting their starbases, forming fleets, and designing heroes for playing (or trading) purposes.</p>
<p id="bc2a" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Additionally, in early 2022 we will be offering private rounds and a public sale for early adopters, followed by a special NFT sale and distribution known as “The Founders Series” which will include rare and exclusive drops for collectors, players, and investors thanks to their utility and functionality within the game.</p>
<p id="2753" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Further NFT sales will be on offer throughout the year with new and unique items, heroes, and ships!</p>
<p id="30db" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Token holders will also have access to exclusive playable builds and will be eligible to participate in the “Council of Angels,” (CoA) our DAO mechanism that allows the players to impact the game and its direction.</p>
<p id="39cd" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">A public token offering will be available as well for players who want to get in on the ground floor. A limited number of beta test keys will be offered to certain early action takers, and your feedback will be crucial to the future development of the game.</p>
<p id="d6ac" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We know we have a long journey ahead of us as we build this together. Beyond building a gaming experience like no other, we have a strong focus on creating an ecosystem that rewards players and community members who help the game succeed. We know this won’t happen overnight, and we invite you to join us as early adopters who will become active members of the Angelic community, get involved in providing insight and feedback, and are excited to share in the success of the most exciting Metaverse gaming project to date.</p>
