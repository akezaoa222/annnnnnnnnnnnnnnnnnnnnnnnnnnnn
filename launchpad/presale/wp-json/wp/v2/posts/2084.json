And here they come: The very first screenshots and even GIFs from the game\u2019s combat.<\/p>\n<p>Today we will talk about combat mechanics. Actually, not just talk. We also see some action.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Turn Based Strategy\u2026 with Our Special Sauce<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Angelic utilizes turn-based combat, and we think people who love and know TBS will quickly learn and adapt our game\u2019s combat aspect. That does not mean we just copied the existing dominant TBS mechanics, though. We also implemented some of our special sauce to make it even more tasty!<\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest differences is the drop pods. Unlike the other TBS games, you do not start with a predetermined set of units and play the combat with the same team. Yes you still have a team, but it is up to you who to \u201cdeploy\u201d where, and even better, it will be possible for you (and for your opponent) to deploy more heroes even after the combat started.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_video src=&#8221;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QIFQKOvMe6Q&#038;list=TLGGL4aJy3BnWeYyMTExMjAyMQ&#038;ab_channel=AngelicTheGame&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;et_body_layout&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;][\/et_pb_video][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#FFFFFF&#8221; text_font_size=&#8221;12px&#8221; text_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;et_body_layout&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u2013 Selin\u00e9 Vivarri arrives on the battlefield. All heroes have their special drop pods, and these vessels act like personal shuttles with some cool combat features. Each pod has different bonuses and abilities. When the battle is over, heroes will use their pods to leave the field and return to Osiris, the mothership. \u2013<\/p>\n<p><\/em><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#FFFFFF&#8221; text_font_size=&#8221;16px&#8221; header_2_text_color=&#8221;#FFFFFF&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;et_body_layout&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>The combat loop consists of some multiple phases. The first phase is the deployment turn. During that phase, players deploy their hero or heroes wherever they want. Each hero costs some deployment energy, so you cannot unleash your entire roster right ahead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Then the battle starts. During the battle turn, heroes take turns according to their initiative stat and act. So battle turns consist of multiple hero turns. The important thing is, players do not take turns and move their units. Heroes take turns and move. It is possible that two heroes from your side can move, then one hero from the opponent team can act, and then one from your side and three from the enemy side, etc\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>When all the units act once, the battle turn is over and the next deployment turn begins. That is a unique aspect, because that means the entire combat will be a very dynamic experience, and the tide of the battle can change anytime! So even if you got the upper hand during the combat turn, the enemy can still balance things out by deploying some critical heroes on strategic positions during the next deployment turn.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Heroes!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Another major difference is the heroes and how we design and position them. Angelic is TBS \u2013 RPG hybrid as you know, so heroes have personalities, preferences, desires\u2026 They are unique.

Their biggest difference is their weapons. Maybe some minor skill and stat differences\u2026 In Angelic, our heroes are massively different from each other. How you use them will dictate the outcome of the battle. A right combination can win the day, while using wrong heroes against wrong opponents can ruin the battle entirely. Strategic thinking is very important, and you must carefully examine the battlefield and the opponents\u2019 units and calculate your next move carefully. Since the game is turn-based, you will have a lot of time to think, no worries.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Zone Control<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"\"><span>So, you can deploy heroes during the deployment turn via drop pods wherever you want, and dramatically change the situation instantly. Does it mean the combat now kind of a random action?
