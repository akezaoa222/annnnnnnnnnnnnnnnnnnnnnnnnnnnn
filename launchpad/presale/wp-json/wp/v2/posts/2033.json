Gameplay-wise, we call them \u201cheroes\u201d. Narrative-wise, they are your companions.

Although we categorize the ship as a mothership, Osiris is quite small compared to other similar ships. Just because Osiris is small compared to other motherships doesn\u2019t mean it is actually small, though; it is still a massive, awe-inspiring, ship to command.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Its most important feature is, however, something incredibly significant: Osiris is the ship of Iset the Mother. In other words, it is a ship that belongs to a goddess.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Commanding a Goddess Ship<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Many revere Iset (also known as Isis) as a goddess because of her immense power and technological advancements. Like all neo-humans, she was once a human. After hundreds of years after her transcendence to neo-human form, her wisdom, technology, and capabilities have advanced beyond comprehension. She is called \u201cthe mother\u201d because she has created a lot of neo-humans so far, most of them are significant characters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Good news for you, you are commanding her personal ship: Osiris. You might ask why and how\u2026 I am afraid you will have to wait a little longer to explore the answers to these questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Let me continue with the ship\u2019s design: We knew from day one that Osiris must be a sleek, elegant, and ultra-techy vessel. At the same time, the ship must inherit some design elements from Iset, its master and engineer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/angelicthegame.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Angelic_Mothership-Sketches-1-1024&#215;576-1.png&#8221; title_text=&#8221;Angelic_Mothership-Sketches-1-1024&#215;576&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#FFFFFF&#8221; text_font_size=&#8221;12px&#8221; text_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\u2013 Early sketches of Osiris.
