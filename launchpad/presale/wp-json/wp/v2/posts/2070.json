When the infestation touches you, it takes only a couple of minutes until it captures your entire body and turns you into something else. This is the main problem with the infestation, it is phenomenally fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Before she got infested, she was a soprano and a ballerina, she lived in one of the outer space human colonies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/angelicthegame.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Odile_the_Black_Swan_Angelic-876&#215;1024-1.jpg&#8221; title_text=&#8221;Odile_the_Black_Swan_Angelic-876&#215;1024&#8243; align=&#8221;center&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;et_body_layout&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#FFFFFF&#8221; text_font_size=&#8221;16px&#8221; header_2_text_color=&#8221;#FFFFFF&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;et_body_layout&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>The thing is, if you are incredibly lucky, you can still control your body and keep your consciousness. You will not be the same person, but you will still be alive. Odile was one of the few lucky people in the universe who\u00a0 have managed to do that. In fact, there are only a few known cases out of the billions of infected humans. She was remarkably lucky, you could say she won an astronomical lottery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Odile is also a capable aisar caster. In other words, she is a sorceress as humans call them. She cannot speak, but it is unclear if that was her own decision or due to the infestation changing her. One will usually feel extremely uncomfortable when they meet the eyes with Odile\u2019s, because it is hard to stand against her cold and piercing gaze. If you can bear it, however, you will notice that there is a deep, enigmatic pain and sorrow planted deep inside her looks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Selin\u00e9 \u201cNightingale\u201d Vivarri<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Many thought that Selin\u00e9\u2019s nickname, Nightingale, comes from her amazingly beautiful voice.

Therefore she gained the right of assigning herself a custom name, and after that, she left the service of corporations when she was just 54 years old. Eugenical humans can live hundreds of years and leaving the service of the corporations is considered to be a very risky move; because these people need a continuous and very expensive treatment to sustain their genetically modified bodies. These services sponsored by the corporations, as long as you remain in their service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Regardless, she decided to leave the TacOps and joined *you*, her lover.

Maybe we will learn the reasons later.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Rumbrogon is a warrior class hero. He is a massive, fearless, and terrorizing melee fighter.

He always follows her, watches her and serves her. Even Daeva was not able to dominate him. Rumbrogon helped Daeva and followed her, but only because Odile was helping Daeva.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Iset the Mother is the second being he respects and listens.
