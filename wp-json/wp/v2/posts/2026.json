Sorry to disappoint you, but the universe is full of chaos. Even worse, according to the second law of thermodynamics, we have the law of entropy, which dictates the existing chaotic order gets even worse continuously.<\/p>\n<p>It might be a surprise for some of you, but if you live in Turkey like me, or if you try to be an entrepreneur in Turkey, you would not argue that Turkey is a chaotic place. We are playing the game in \u00fcber-hardcore mode all the time. So, when the world literally stood still during the Covid-19 outbreak, we Turkish entrepreneurs are like \u201c\u2026just another crisis, it will also pass\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When things got bad for even Turkish standards, everybody starting to close their companies, halting their investments, and literally going into hiding, I realized a golden opportunity had arisen for me. I decided to go all in.<\/p>\n<p>In 2009, when the world was hit by the mortgage crisis, my first game company (C\u00e9idot Game Studios) almost went bankrupt. In 2013, we had massive political turmoil in Turkey, which also affected the economy and all my investor talks collapsed. In 2016, we suffered at the hands of an attempted military coup in Turkey; that was the killer blow for the first attempt of Metaverse.<\/p>\n<p>And this year\u2026 Covid-19 caused an unprecedented, catastrophic crisis and the second attempt of founding Metaverse had collapsed again.<\/p>\n<p>One week later we decided to kill the initiative. I realized that I was doing something wrong. Very wrong.<\/p>\n<p>I must say, because I am also a trader, I had to master the skill of controlling my emotions. Furthermore, I learned the value of thinking differently than the herd, seeing opportunities when everybody is terrified. In the 18th century, Baron Rothschild said \u201cbuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets\u201d. Believe me, it is a powerful strategy if you have some solid nerves. Remembering my trading lessons also helped me to identify the mistake I was making.<\/p>\n<p>Recalling that my greatest achievements happened when I acted boldly and kept going no matter what happens helped me pinpoint the problem, as well. The final motivation came from a very unexpected source, however.<\/p>\n<p>Suddenly, YouTube suggested this video to me:<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_video src=&#8221;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DjffIi2Pl7M&#038;t=101s&#038;ab_channel=KenanTahirovich&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;][\/et_pb_video][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#FFFFFF&#8221; text_font_size=&#8221;16px&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ride the Storm!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On that day I recalled a lost talent of mine: Ability to ride the storms!<\/p>\n<p>I was trying to play safe, way too much. I knew Angelic was a solid project. I trusted the idea and my skills. I knew people would start to follow me once I set myself on the road. However, I kept looking for additional safety measures.<\/p>\n<p>Fear is a perfect motivational source. If you use it properly, it is a significant ally. It is the only power that keeps you smart, agile, disciplined, and focused all the time. In order to achieve the bold goals of Angelic, I had to fear.<\/p>\n<p>I was once a storm rider. I knew the secrets of riding that dark, yet wildly beautiful chaotic tempest. You need to sync yourself up with its dreadful swings. Sometimes you need to gently push it, sometimes you need to obey it. Mostly you need to think fast and rarely you will have second chances. So yes, it is a risky business. Riding storms\u2026<\/p>\n<p>And to succeed, first and foremost, you need to cut the rope.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_image src=&#8221;https:\/\/angelicthegame.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/DaevaFront_withCopyright-e1637520936895.jpg&#8221; title_text=&#8221;DaevaFront_withCopyright&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;][\/et_pb_image][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.13.1&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; text_text_color=&#8221;#FFFFFF&#8221; text_font_size=&#8221;12px&#8221; text_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p class=\"\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><span>\u201cOld ones say we have all fallen while trying\u00a0<\/span><\/i><i>to ascend.
