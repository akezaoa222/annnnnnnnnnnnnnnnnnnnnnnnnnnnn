We will keep focusing on the narrative side of the game in this article and in the next one.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>We are quite close to releasing our narrative trailer, yet we cannot relay all the details of our lore and story with a single movie, of course. Consider this diary post as a predecessor of the upcoming trailer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>So far, we know that the future is quite dark and Earth is mostly a barren place now. Overpopulation and industrialization caused an irreversible climate crisis. To make things worse, humanity suffered three nuclear wars. From the ashes of the old world, the era of the corporations rose. People are no longer citizens of governments, but employees of companies. There are a lot of \u201cundercities\u201d and \u201cdeepcities\u201d, meaning cities under the ground or deep in the ocean; all because of the massive radiation on the ground. Limited \u201cclean\u201d territories all belong to the rich and elite. Some corporations host even sky cities, floating massive structures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>What about the others? Unless you are a high-level manager or engineer; or a relative to a big corporation\u2019s shareholder, life is quite hard for you. Many call these people \u201cthe forsaken\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Angelicon was a very marginal company, indeed. Founders of the company made a fortune during the second global nuclear crisis; known as the second doomsday wars, by aggressively buying the stocks of banks, transportation, energy, and entertainment companies. Right after the cease-fire period, prices of these stocks skyrocketed, and the founders became trillionaires. Quickly they started up Angelicon, a robotics, pharmaceutical, and genetics company. Just before the third nuclear war, they got hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of contracts from mega-corporations and announced a next-gen synth soldier project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>The third war declared but thanks to Angelicon\u2019s rapid progress on such spectacular technologies, did not continue for a long time. Already exhausted, Lilac Crocus and Celtic Triquetra accepted to surrender, and the world was saved from ultimate annihilation. Angelicon became a hero for many, although they were still relatively small, they got incredibly famous fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Their neutral stance against the big guys was not to last, however. Ambitions were about to clash.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>\u201cProject Transcendence\u201d<\/b><\/h2>\n<p class=\"\"><span>Angelicon\u2019s rise towards the top tier of the unforgiving pyramid of corporations was just beginning. They had managed to stay neutral for decades and even when they must pick sides, they were at least sympathetic in the eyes of the opponents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>It all changed when they declared an overly ambitious project: Transcendence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>All of a sudden, they became a threat to all big corporations, cartels, syndicates, and trusts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"\"><span>We will continue our journey on the backstory of the game next week.
