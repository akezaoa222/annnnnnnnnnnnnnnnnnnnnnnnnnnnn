The short answer is: Angelic is a narrative single/multiplayer strategy RPG backed by the blockchain and set in a collaborative sci-fi metaverse.</p>
<p id="c4c7" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Great. What does that mean?</p></div>

<p id="eb10" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is for fans of single-player games where you join a massive conflict and will have to question the morality of humanity, and struggle to make the right decision most of the time in the dark sci-fi universe of Angelic.</p>
<p id="8725" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is for fans of multiplayer games where you build guilds, form alliances, and make an impact on the deep space colonies by your actions.</p>
<p id="23fe" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is for fans of the power of blockchain and the metaverse. People who enjoy crafting NFTs that can be used, earned, traded, and more.</p>
<p id="ab65" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is for people who like to play and earn, not just play to earn.</p>
<p id="2655" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is for people who would like to have a say in how their game develops and even love to contribute to the design of the IP.</p>
<p id="e431" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic is the future of gaming and we’ve got the team to back it up.</p>
<p id="8dbe" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Okay, so you’re convinced? Excellent! Let’s dive a little deeper into what you can expect from the game</p>

<p id="6a06" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’ve already explained that Angelic is a game with many facets. Everything is built around the lore of a dark and compelling universe. You find yourself in the future taking on the persona of Phoenix, a prototype neo-human raised from death by Iset the Mother for reasons known only to her.</p>
<p id="4abc" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">A fungal plague is rapidly encroaching on inhabited worlds, corporations are at each other’s throats, and the return of neo-humans is not helping. Or perhaps the return of Iset is exactly what humanity needs to survive.</p>
<p id="f1b1" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jp">Single-Player Mode</strong></p>
<p id="1da2" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">In single-player mode you take your place in a massive conflict, commanding a one-of-a-kind spaceship that reveals its secrets and capabilities to you as you progress through the story. You’ll run missions with companions that you meet along the way. Your companions have their own unique motivations, desires, and beliefs. Part of your job will be to balance their needs against yours and their skills against the missions you take them on. The more you progress through the story the better you’ll understand your allies and forge a team to change the course of the war.</p>
<p id="846b" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">You’re able to customize your companions, craft unique items (even ships), and progress through skill trees with a wide array of abilities and skills. Your experience will be unique to you, based on the decisions you make in the game.</p>
<p id="e6ff" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">While your single-player avatar and heroes will be different than those in multiplayer mode you’ll still gain benefits in multiplayer mode from your activities in the solo game.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p id="5eba" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jp">Multiplayer Mode</strong></p>
<p id="1e8d" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic also offers a massively multiplayer gaming experience, though we do suggest you finish the single-player campaign before joining the larger metaverse (but that’s up to you. You can jump straight into multiplayer mode if you prefer)</p>
<p id="9baa" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">In Multiplayer mode you’ll create your custom avatar and join one of many neo-human alliances, each with its own requirements, agendas, and idiosyncrasies. Choose from:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="fee9" class="jr js he cg b id ie ih ii il jt ip ju it jv ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Prodigies — science-based and elite.</li>
<li id="e670" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Chaos Symphony — Order is an illusion, Chaos is the real force behind all things.</li>
<li id="6bfc" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Sky Legion — Mercenaries with a code, and a plan.</li>
<li id="0161" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Crimson Angels — Healers with a mission to save their founder.</li>
<li id="2370" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Phantom Crows — Shadows in the universe, little is known about them, perhaps you’ll be the first.</li>
<li id="b905" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Unbound — Unaffiliated, unconcerned with the goings on of the galaxy…probably.</li>
</ul>
<p id="bc26" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Players can also form their own guilds, each governed by their own separate DAO entity. Guilds can decide how to expand, which planets to colonize, and even build their own space stations. Guilds generate revenues from their activities and investments and that revenue is divided amongst the players making them much more than a simple social organization.</p>
<p id="7e49" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">In Multiplayer mode the Sol System is dominated by the corporations, but you have free rein to shape the deeper regions of space through your actions.</p>
<p id="e00b" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Additionally, you’ll find many multiplayer missions, co-op battles, and even guild wars. You can join or watch from afar, again the choices are yours. There’s even a PVP option with real rewards and losses on the line.</p>
<p id="70e5" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jp">Character Progression</strong></p>
<p id="45a8" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">As your heroes and avatar gain experience from combat, missions, mega-construction projects, or community events you’ll be able to unlock new abilities and features for your character. Each hero has a different skill tree allowing you to create a custom lineup for your team. Abilities can work together and you may find some powerful combinations that you didn’t expect.</p>
<p id="2446" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">You’ll also be able to customize your ships. At this time there are four ship types:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="fbc9" class="jr js he cg b id ie ih ii il jt ip ju it jv ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">CARRIERS: Expand your team size.</li>
<li id="d3e6" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">DROPSHIPS: Required for special missions such as infiltration and stealth operations, which you cannot participate with a carrier class ship.</li>
<li id="14a7" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">FIGHTER DRONES: Fully autonomous battleships. Size and capabilities vary. Required to protect your colonies, space stations, starbases, etc…</li>
<li id="7029" class="jr js he cg b id ka ih kb il kc ip kd it ke ix jw jx jy jz fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">MINING DRONES: Autonomous mining drones, necessary for space mining operations (except on-site mining actions)</li>
</ul>
<p id="2c5b" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jp">Crafting</strong></p>
<p id="01ac" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’ll be releasing another article on crafting soon, but for the moment let&#8217;s just talk about the fact that not only can you craft unique items, you can craft unique NFT heroes which you can then rent or sell to other players in the game! Crafting is an important part of your story progression and you’ll even be able to craft unique ships!</p>
<p id="b3b6" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Crafting also allows you to upgrade your gadgets to suit the needs of the missions ahead of you!</p>
<p id="686a" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Crafting falls into five categories:</p>
<p id="e642" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Item crafting: To include weapons, armor, hero skins, accessories, and more.</p>
<p id="a1f9" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Meta estates: Create your own version of a home in the Angelic Metaverse, you can rent or sell these as you see fit.</p>
<p id="f945" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Heroes: Technically you’re not crafting the hero so much as training them up for your missions (or to sell to other players)</p>
<p id="97d7" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Vehicles: Find the blueprints, components, and resources and you can create, buy, or rent ships from others in the Metaverse!</p>
<p id="5b07" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Colonization and Mega-Projects: In conjunction with other players you can undertake the task of creating starbases, wonder projects (landmarks), and even colonizing planets!</p>
<p id="45bb" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">There’s a lot more to unpack so keep your eyes peeled for the deep dive into crafting!</p></div>

<p id="59bb" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Here’s another topic that should (and will) be an article in and of itself. We’re leaning into the ability of blockchain technology to allow our players to actually contribute to the development of the game by way of the Council of Angels.</p>
<p id="0759" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Players holding $ANGL coin will be able to vote on the direction of the game, connect with developers, and truly impact the future of the game that they love. The Council of Angels will be the player governing body, taking feedback from the community and putting into action and allowing us to better understand what you want as the universe expands.</p>
<p id="d534" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jp">Whew, that was a lot to cover in one go.</strong></p>
<p id="e46e" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’re posting articles twice a week to give updates, explain details of the game, and dive further into every aspect of the game. Coming soon will be more detail on crafting, blockchain, and NFTs in gaming, character/hero profiles, and more. If there’s something you specifically want to know more about it, find us on social media and let us know! In the meantime, there’s more information about everything we discussed today on our<span> </span>website.</p>
<p id="8f13" class="ib ic he cg b id ie if ig ih ii ij ik il im in io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">We look forward to sharing more and connecting with you, here or in the metaverse!</p></div>

<p id="39a7" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cg jj">What Is Angelic?</strong></p>
<p id="2865" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Set in a dark science fiction universe, Angelic is a compelling narrative RPG that puts the players in the driver’s seat as they explore and even shape the worlds they’re playing in (more on this in just a moment).</p>
<p id="d21f" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">By combining the best of online gaming, RPGs, turn-based strategy, and distinctive, colorful heroes in a player-driven universe, Angelic really is the first game of its kind.</p>
<p id="68e2" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">With equal emphasis on storytelling and party-based RPG elements, Angelic players are drawn into a dark and compelling science fiction setting. Mesmerizing stories unfold as players progress through a complex universe where motivations may not always be clear, and where allies can be the key to success…or disaster.</p>
<p id="eb96" class="im in he cg b io ip iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji gx fq" data-selectable-paragraph="">Angelic will be one of the first playable AA+ releases, and our three-hour demo has already been gaining rave reviews and will be available for limited beta play in the coming months.</p>

			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_10  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Last week I mentioned there might be a surprise for you this week. And here they come: The very first screenshots and even GIFs from the game’s combat.</p>
<p>Today we will talk about combat mechanics. Actually, not just talk. We also see some action.</p>
<h2><strong>Turn Based Strategy… with Our Special Sauce</strong></h2>
<p>Angelic utilizes turn-based combat, and we think people who love and know TBS will quickly learn and adapt our game’s combat aspect. That does not mean we just copied the existing dominant TBS mechanics, though. We also implemented some of our special sauce to make it even more tasty!</p>
<p>One of the biggest differences is the drop pods. Unlike the other TBS games, you do not start with a predetermined set of units and play the combat with the same team. Yes you still have a team, but it is up to you who to “deploy” where, and even better, it will be possible for you (and for your opponent) to deploy more heroes even after the combat started.</p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_video et_pb_video_1">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_video_box"><iframe title="Angelic - Captain’s Log Entry #9 - Seliné&#039;s Arrival with Drop Pod" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QIFQKOvMe6Q?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_11  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="" style="text-align: center;"><em>– Seliné Vivarri arrives on the battlefield. All heroes have their special drop pods, and these vessels act like personal shuttles with some cool combat features. Each pod has different bonuses and abilities. When the battle is over, heroes will use their pods to leave the field and return to Osiris, the mothership. –</p>
<p></em></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_12  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>The combat loop consists of some multiple phases. The first phase is the deployment turn. During that phase, players deploy their hero or heroes wherever they want. Each hero costs some deployment energy, so you cannot unleash your entire roster right ahead.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Then the battle starts. During the battle turn, heroes take turns according to their initiative stat and act. So battle turns consist of multiple hero turns. The important thing is, players do not take turns and move their units. Heroes take turns and move. It is possible that two heroes from your side can move, then one hero from the opponent team can act, and then one from your side and three from the enemy side, etc…</span></p>
<p class=""><span>When all the units act once, the battle turn is over and the next deployment turn begins. That is a unique aspect, because that means the entire combat will be a very dynamic experience, and the tide of the battle can change anytime! So even if you got the upper hand during the combat turn, the enemy can still balance things out by deploying some critical heroes on strategic positions during the next deployment turn.</span></p>
<h2><b>Heroes!</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Another major difference is the heroes and how we design and position them. Angelic is TBS – RPG hybrid as you know, so heroes have personalities, preferences, desires… They are unique. I am not only talking about their looks or characteristics; I am also talking about their “abilities”.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_video et_pb_video_2">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_video_box"><iframe title="Angelic - Captain&#039;s Log #9 - Aurora’s Charged Shot" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x4mEn0733XE?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_13  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="" style="text-align: center;"><em>– A well placed ability can dramatically change the outcome of battles. Aurora’s “Charged Shot” can penetrate everybody on its trajectory (friend or foe, so be careful). Heroes have unique skills, abilities and weapons. Use them masterfully and you can win every kind of encounter no matter the odds! –</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_14  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Most of the TBS games feature “soldiers” that are almost identical with each other. Their biggest difference is their weapons. Maybe some minor skill and stat differences… In Angelic, our heroes are massively different from each other. How you use them will dictate the outcome of the battle. A right combination can win the day, while using wrong heroes against wrong opponents can ruin the battle entirely. Strategic thinking is very important, and you must carefully examine the battlefield and the opponents’ units and calculate your next move carefully. Since the game is turn-based, you will have a lot of time to think, no worries.</span></p>
<h2><b>Zone Control</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>So, you can deploy heroes during the deployment turn via drop pods wherever you want, and dramatically change the situation instantly. Does it mean the combat now kind of a random action? On the contrary, that means everything can change all of a sudden so you must control your zone(s) carefully!</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_video et_pb_video_3">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_video_box"><iframe title="Angelic - Captain&#039;s Log #9 - Daeva&#039;s Void Storm" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_iJWM7xBq4?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
				
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_15  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="" style="text-align: center;"><em> – Daeva’s Void Storm is a dreadful ability which affects a massive area and can potentially kill multiple enemies on one go. If you are up against heroes who can deal area damage, you should be careful while positioning your heroes. But if you place your heroes too loosely, you might not be able to protect your weaker heroes especially against melee assailants. Decisions… Consequences… –</em></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_16  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Angelic is also a tactical game. Strategy, building a grand plan, is important as I said. Tactics are equally important, because even if you bring the right team against the right opponent, you still have to deploy them carefully and use their skills smartly. Although there will be a progression system for heroes (like upgrading their weapons or levelling up their abilities), upgrades or enhancements cannot make up for bad tactics.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>I know it is quite hard to understand, yet alone feel the combat with just mere words and some short videos. Bad news is, that is all I can offer for this week. Good news is, next week will be big!</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Thank you for reading. Do not forget to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/qvQnCyX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a> and hold tight till next week, which will be awesome! </span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Angelic features many significant characters, we have briefly shared the concepts and details of Iset the Mother and Daeva before. Now, it is time to talk about the others a bit.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>This is going to be a quick and brief introduction. Much more information will be shared throughout this month.</span></p>
<p><span>So… Let’s meet the rest of the crew!</span></p>
<h2><b>Odile the Black Swan</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Odile is an infested human lady. When the infestation touches you, it takes only a couple of minutes until it captures your entire body and turns you into something else. This is the main problem with the infestation, it is phenomenally fast.</span></p>
<p><span>Before she got infested, she was a soprano and a ballerina, she lived in one of the outer space human colonies.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_7">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Odile_the_Black_Swan_Angelic-876x1024-1.jpg" alt="" title="Odile_the_Black_Swan_Angelic-876x1024" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_18  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>The thing is, if you are incredibly lucky, you can still control your body and keep your consciousness. You will not be the same person, but you will still be alive. Odile was one of the few lucky people in the universe who  have managed to do that. In fact, there are only a few known cases out of the billions of infected humans. She was remarkably lucky, you could say she won an astronomical lottery.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Odile is also a capable aisar caster. In other words, she is a sorceress as humans call them. She cannot speak, but it is unclear if that was her own decision or due to the infestation changing her. One will usually feel extremely uncomfortable when they meet the eyes with Odile’s, because it is hard to stand against her cold and piercing gaze. If you can bear it, however, you will notice that there is a deep, enigmatic pain and sorrow planted deep inside her looks.</span></p>
<h2><b>Seliné “Nightingale” Vivarri</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Many thought that Seliné’s nickname, Nightingale, comes from her amazingly beautiful voice. The truth is, however, that she is a keen admirer of a great historic figure, Florence Nightingale, who lived during the 19</span><span>th</span><span> Century and considered to be the founding mother of the nursing profession.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_8">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Seline_Vivarri_InGame_Angelic-995x1024-1.jpg" alt="" title="Seline_Vivarri_InGame_Angelic-995x1024" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_19  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Seliné is a second-generation neo-human. She utilizes an enhanced version of a standard female neo-human body, with a cool holographic face projection feature.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Her main profession is being a supermedic. She is an expert doctor, practitioner, engineer and healer and capable of helping humans, eugenics, cybernetics, synths, neo-humans and even infested organisms. There are many supermedics in the ranks of neo-humans; but only Seliné (apart from Iset) can understand and heal physiology and anatomy of the infested.</span></p>
<h2><b>Zarya “Aurora” Mólnija</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>She is one of the two heroes who has human origin. Technically, she is an eugenical (genetically crafted and modified super human) hero.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_9">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aurora_Ingame_Angelic-1024x847-1.jpg" alt="" title="Aurora_Ingame_Angelic-1024x847" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_20  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Eugenical people are both lucky and unlucky; because they have super abilities and talents but they also lack a family and a proper childhood. They are being created, raised and enhanced in eugenics farms and specifically crafted to serve corporations.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Aurora was able to fulfill her duties in 43 years, 7 years before the average service time threshold, as a hunter class tactical operations corporal. Therefore she gained the right of assigning herself a custom name, and after that, she left the service of corporations when she was just 54 years old. Eugenical humans can live hundreds of years and leaving the service of the corporations is considered to be a very risky move; because these people need a continuous and very expensive treatment to sustain their genetically modified bodies. These services sponsored by the corporations, as long as you remain in their service. </span></p>
<p class=""><span>Regardless, she decided to leave the TacOps and joined *you*, her lover. She wanted to start a new life in deep space colonies. She had dreams, ideals…</span></p>
<p class=""><span>You will learn what happens to her next when we launch the game.</span></p>
<h2><b>Rumbrogon</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Rumbrogon is one of the few aliens who is still alive. All known alien civilizations were annihilated by infestations. Somehow Rumbrogon managed to survive and maintain his body’s control even after he got infested.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_10">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Rumbrogon_Ingame_Angelic-1024x870-1.jpg" alt="" title="Rumbrogon_Ingame_Angelic-1024x870" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_21  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span>Daeva found Rumbrogon and Odile long ago, and even she had no idea how they met with each other, why they were together and who they were before the infestation. Iset quickly realized their importance and learned their common past. Yet she did not share all the pieces. Why? Maybe we will learn the reasons later.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Rumbrogon is a warrior class hero. He is a massive, fearless, and terrorizing melee fighter. He wields a giant two-handed sword; and thanks to his unreal regeneration skills (a side benefit of being an infested) he becomes a terrifying force.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Odile is so precious to him; to a point that in the past many times he risked his own life to protect his “queen”. He always follows her, watches her and serves her. Even Daeva was not able to dominate him. Rumbrogon helped Daeva and followed her, but only because Odile was helping Daeva.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Iset the Mother is the second being he respects and listens. It is unclear if that is because Odile also respects Iset, or simply because Rumbrogon admires and fears Iset.</span></p>
<h2><b>Xander Aidan</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Xander is a war veteran and a former stormtrooper of Hoshi Ryū and Celtic Triquetra corporations. He left the Earth when he was just a kid, followed his father and joined the military. For years he fought for the corporations, enhanced his body to be a better soldier and lost many friends. It was a hell of a journey.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Losing friends was devastating enough, but something else drove him off the domestic human space…</span></p>
<p class=""><span> </span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_11">
				
				
				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Xander_Aidan_Angelic-1024x836-1.jpg" alt="" title="Xander_Aidan_Angelic-1024x836" /></span>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_22  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light">
				
				
				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>A decade ago, he lost his wife in a very tragic way. She was pregnant and killed brutally by extremist pirates.</span><span> Corporations used that disastrous death for their propaganda. Instead of really helping him to get his revenge, corporations just abused his pain. That is how and when he decided to flee the military service and try his luck in outer space.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>You cannot simply quit the service once you signed a contract with a mega corporation. Xander, however, did just that. Effectively he became a defector and criminal. He spent 3 years escaping from the domestic space, and along the way he met with Aurora and *you*, player.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Xander and Aurora are your dear friends. You all have the same thing in common: you had to escape from your past and left everything behind. You found each other, supported each other, and survived together in the harsh and unforgiving outer space theater.</span> </p>
<p class=""><span>But who are you? What is your name? Your appearance, past, story… So far we reviewed Iset the Mother, Daeva, Odile, Aurora, Rumbrogon, Seliné and Xander. There is one more major character left: You.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Later…</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Thank you for reading and please join our <a href="https://discord.gg/qvQnCyX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>, as well.</span></p>
<p><span>Next week we might have a surprise for you guys, stay tuned!</span></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Welcome to another weekly developer diary post! So far, we discussed the reason why we started this project, and how we managed to do it. We also talked about the ship we will command (Osiris) and some important aspects regarding the companions, or heroes as we call them. During the last two weeks, we briefly visited the massive lore of Angelic, learned some details about major historical events.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>We talked about a lot of things, but we never discussed the future.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>How do we plan to proceed until Kickstarter? What would be the next steps for the project? If you are wondering the answers of these questions, this diary entry is for you.</span></p></div>
			</div><div class="et_pb_module et_pb_image et_pb_image_12">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class="" style="text-align: center;"><em>– Angel cores are like the backup drives of neo-humans. The most dreadful thing for a neo-human is to be losing her neo-human core. It is like losing some of your memories, or some part of your consciousness. If you lose all of them, you are dead.

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Narrative Trailer</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>We have promised you a narrative trailer, and we deliver you one. Soon.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>It is already finished, but we are waiting for something else in order to release the trailer. We want a powerful reveal event, so instead of releasing key materials one by one, we will launch most of them together. For that reason, the narrative trailer will have to wait a little longer.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>However, do not worry. I believe you’re going to like what you are about to see. We are working really hard to deliver you quality content, the narrative trailer is no exception. A lot of people worked like crazy to create something exciting. It is a pain for us to hold it back for some more time, believe me. We are all looking forward to releasing it as soon as possible, but our PR and marketing strategies dictate that we wait.</span></p>
<h2><b>Gameplay Reveal</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Gameplay content, or at least a single screenshot from the game was number one demand from you and we are all aware of that. However, once again, our obsession with quality holds us back. We have something really promising and beautiful at the moment. Still, we do not want to publish anything from the game before we polish the content to a level which we would all feel content.</span></p>
<p><span>In August, however, I can say that we will start releasing gameplay-related materials, footage, and screenshots. Of course, there is always a risk of delay, but at the moment it is our plan.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><strong>Kickstarter Date</strong></h2>
<p>As you know, we were getting ready for the Kickstarter campaign, and we were targeting September 2020 from the beginning to initiate the campaign. That does not mean we will launch the game on that date. Please do not confuse them.</p>
<p>Also please note that September is a tentative date for the campaign. It might slip. Quality is super important for us, so if we need more time, we might delay the date a bit. Of course, if we do that, we will let you know, and we will do our best to not delay the date.</p>
<p>Unless we encounter a major setback or problem, I think we will catch our tentative deadline. Moreover, we should be able to release some cool in-game content next month. August will be hot people, get ready!</p>
<p>Thank you for your support so far. Please support us by spreading the word and inviting your friends to our website and Discord server</p>
<p>Thanks and see you next week</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Hope is a Dangerous Thing</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Project Transcendence was a declaration of open war against all of the corporations. This world’s system is based on a “professional slavery,” and even the possibility of elevating random people towards the top of the pyramid, with unseen talents, amazing intellectual capabilities and potentially immortal bodies was a cardinal sin in the eyes of the mega corporations.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Only 24 hours after the project’s announcement, The Supreme Cartel, a union of the mega corporations which practically acted as a form of global government, gave a warning to Angelicon. However, it was an expected reaction, and Angelicon had no desire to fight against the big guys. At least, not yet.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>They played smart. With tons of political maneuvers and some compromises, The Supreme Cartel gave the greenlight for the project. However, the decision of who was going to transcend into a neo-human is now in the hands of the cartel executives and the project quickly became the elite’s path to immortality.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>While explaining the reason why they decided to limit the program’s reach, The Supreme Arbiter of the cartel summarized that </span><i><span>“…hope is a dangerous thing. Give too less to the masses, they become unstable. Give too much, they become dangerous. And you are giving it way too much, gentleman.</span></i><span>”</span></p>
<h2><b>They are the Forsaken Ones!</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Within less than a year, complications began to arise. Neo-humans, also known as “the angels”, started to show signs of serious psychological problems. More and more of them wanted to go back to their human forms over time, which was impossible. When some high-profile neo-humans committed suicide or completely lost it and started to act wildly, the Supreme Cartel decided to pause the program and authorized seven inspectors to investigate what was going on.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>They found that the safest way of transcending into a neo-human had an extremely high personal cost: One must accept to erase his or her memories; at least, most of them. The rich did not want to lose their path to immortality, so they accepted the solution offered by Angelicon executives and their scientists: an expansion of the program.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Years later, the Supreme Cartel would realize that it was a trap. Initially, though, it was perceived as a great solution to save the program. It was simply about opening the program to the masses. To “the forsaken ones”, as one global media company famously described. The real intention was to use people as test subjects, until a proper fix was found for the dreadful psychological side effects of the transcendence.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>The hidden reason; however, was something else. Angelicon knew from the beginning that to properly transcend, the candidate’s memories must be almost entirely wiped out. From day one, they also knew there was no fix. The entire promise of the expansion program was a lie. They were not after a way to find a transfer of a human being into an angel with his or her full memories. They were after a revolution.</span></p>
<h2><b>Interhuman Wars</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Thousands of people volunteered, they had nothing to lose. Almost an immortal body, infinite life and god like powers were promised. It was a good deal. In fact, it was a “too good to be true” kind of a deal.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Years have passed without any notable development on the fix; but something else was attracting attention: Neo-humans’ amazing capabilities and speed at developing technologies. They have encyclopedic memories and superb intellectual skills. They never tire, do not require to sleep, or eat, do not have any kind of emotional instability issues. They have an amazing efficiency. While Angelicon’s share value was skyrocketing, all the big corporations found themselves competing to grab more technologies and privileges from the creators of the angels. Within a decade, neo-humans silently grabbed most of the strategic positions within the corporations and replaced a lot of the workforce.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>For the ordinary people, Angelicon became the ultimate enemy. Neo-humans were threatening their jobs and future. Yet a lot of people were still trying to transcend, because they knew there was no feasible way to stop that revolution. A lot of people were planning to destroy the company, on the other hand. However, Angelicon has an impenetrable shield. It was a very unexpected ally’s protection: The Supreme Cartel’s member corporations.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Why? Because now they all depend on Angelicon’s technology. They both envy them and admire them. They all know the potential danger yet cannot unify and try to digest Angelicon because they did not trust each other. At least Angelicon had no direct military division or army. They were no threat.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>That assumption proved to be the greatest mistake humankind ever made.</span></p></div>

However history records show Iset’s refusal of helping corporations against the rebel angels as the real beginning of the great war. –</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>In 2522, the first rebel neo-human reported. She refused to continue working for Hoshi Ryū, a giant corporation headquartered in former Japan. Dozens of neo-humans followed her rebellion and wanted to break free from the chains of corporations. All have been eliminated brutally.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Rebellions spread, however, in the following months. Celtic Triquetra, Lilac Crocus, Red Syndicate and Asteria were among the heavily affected mega corporations. Despite the global media’s efforts, neo-humans managed to leak tons of information about the corporation’s shady dealings and unfair treatments to their employees, human and neo-human alike. A global revolt began.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>In 2524 The Supreme Cartel declared neo-humans “illegal”, effectively marking them for mass execution. Angelicon strongly protested that decision, and as a result their membership status was stalled by the Cartel.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Many people believed that Angelicon was secretly helping the rebel angels, and in 2526 the Cartel decided to cancel the trade license of the company, which practically means war against it. However, it quickly became clear that even Angelicon has lost their control over neo-humans.</span></p>
<p class=""><strong>The question was, who was leading them then?</strong></p>
<p class=""><span>Daeva, a secret neo-human prototype, who was engineered by Iset herself without the knowledge of the Cartel, but with the blessing of Angelicon top executives, revealed herself in 2527 before she blew up the Celtic Triquetra’s multi-million bitcoin worth space station.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>It was the grandest space station of humankind. It was the day when the interhuman war began globally. Yet not the entire neo-human population was actively fighting against the corporations. Hundreds of millions of humans were also rioting against the companies, as well. So the Cartel was not up against the rebel angels only. They were also busy with restless “forsaken ones”.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>War escalated quickly. Rebel angels kept hacking corporations’ data and they managed to create a global chaos. In 7</span><span>th</span><span> of July 2527, Iset, the very first neo-human ever created, decided to join the rebellion by refusing the help request coming from Angelicon company itself. Her decision marked the official beginning of the interhuman war; because millions of neo-humans also joined the rebellion afterwards and days later all the corporations united against them.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Now called as the “fallen angels”, neo-humans shifted their strategies and instead of playing defensive with some guerrilla tactics, under Iset’s leadership, they started to act offensively. Within weeks the Cartel found itself defending its own bases and assets. The second wave led by Iset proved to be a massive force with unforeseen technologies and new “arch-angels”. Apart from Daeva, who was revealed herself before, they realized that Iset has created a lot of super advanced neo-humans.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Atum the Mysterious led the offensive against Lilac Crocus. Kayra and Andraste (the Chaos twins) were fighting against Angelicon. Sigrun and Siegfried AKA Valkyries, along with Eir the Merciful, Minerva the Owl, and Lywen the Red (Crimson Angels) united against Asteria and Red Syndicate. Badb, Macha and Annand, collectively called the Phantom Crows, were giving hell to Hoshi Ryū. They have three things in common. They were listening to Iset, they were all using mythological and historical names, and they came out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>In 2528, within seven months, fallen angels literally devastated the corporations. The Supreme Cartel asked for unconditional surrender. For days, they did not receive any reply. It was the day the world stood still.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Then, mysteriously, angels started to retreat. Nobody understood what was happening. In two weeks they all gone.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>The abrupt end of the interhuman war was a turning point for humanity. What happened after the war? How has human society evolved? What was the fate of the Cartel and mega corporations? Why did the neo-humans decide to retreat and what happened to them?</span></p>
<p class=""><span>We will discuss these topics later.</span></p>

<p><i><span>Betrayed by the infinite stupidity of humanity.</span></i></p>
<p class=""><i><span>Billions of people had become obsolete. Our new world did not need their muscle power, it had machines. It did not need their services; bots were far better. The world just needed engineers, scientists, managers, and entertainers. The latter was just for paralyzing the masses.</span></i></p>
<p class=""><i><span>The new world did not even need harlots. Can you believe it? Not…even…harlots! Some say theirs was the oldest profession in humanity’s history. In ancient times, both Romans and Egyptians, as well as Sumerians respected them, mostly for religious reasons. Most of the cultures despised them, while secretly enjoying their company. How fitting to humanity’s double-faced nature…</span></i></p>
<p><i><span> And the new dark world… It did not even need them. Fuck me. That was something, wasn’t it?</span></i></p>
<p class=""><i><span> And what I have done? I have fixed it, you fools! I fixed the greatest problem of the new word! *I* fixed it! I found a perfect solution for the “idle masses”! Don’t you understand? Strip the feeling of hope from the masses and they became monsters! They destroy everything you think you hold in safety. Give them some hope, even if it is an illusion, does not matter. You control them. Control them for good.</span></i></p>
<p class=""><i><span>*I* was the ultimate redeemer of your fucking broken world. And you! You fucked it up. If only you could have waited a little more… Until I… I… Well fuck it, does not matter anymore.</span></i></p>
<p class=""><i><span>Now you judge me. Do you dare to discuss my execution?! Just because some of my angels gone wild? Hah! So be it. Have it your way. When Angelicon is gone, the world as you know it will be gone, too. Maybe tomorrow, maybe a century later. But I can promise you this: It will be gone!</span></i></p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>While the Giants are Battling…</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>I wanted to write a different developer diary this time and share a piece of the story with you. We will keep focusing on the narrative side of the game in this article and in the next one.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>We are quite close to releasing our narrative trailer, yet we cannot relay all the details of our lore and story with a single movie, of course. Consider this diary post as a predecessor of the upcoming trailer.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>So far, we know that the future is quite dark and Earth is mostly a barren place now. Overpopulation and industrialization caused an irreversible climate crisis. To make things worse, humanity suffered three nuclear wars. From the ashes of the old world, the era of the corporations rose. People are no longer citizens of governments, but employees of companies. There are a lot of “undercities” and “deepcities”, meaning cities under the ground or deep in the ocean; all because of the massive radiation on the ground. Limited “clean” territories all belong to the rich and elite. Some corporations host even sky cities, floating massive structures.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>What about the others? Unless you are a high-level manager or engineer; or a relative to a big corporation’s shareholder, life is quite hard for you. Many call these people “the forsaken”.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Angelicon was a very marginal company, indeed. Founders of the company made a fortune during the second global nuclear crisis; known as the second doomsday wars, by aggressively buying the stocks of banks, transportation, energy, and entertainment companies. Right after the cease-fire period, prices of these stocks skyrocketed, and the founders became trillionaires. Quickly they started up Angelicon, a robotics, pharmaceutical, and genetics company. Just before the third nuclear war, they got hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of contracts from mega-corporations and announced a next-gen synth soldier project.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>The third war declared but thanks to Angelicon’s rapid progress on such spectacular technologies, did not continue for a long time. Already exhausted, Lilac Crocus and Celtic Triquetra accepted to surrender, and the world was saved from ultimate annihilation. Angelicon became a hero for many, although they were still relatively small, they got incredibly famous fast.</span></p>
<p><span>Their neutral stance against the big guys was not to last, however. Ambitions were about to clash.</span></p>
<h2><b>“Project Transcendence”</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Angelicon’s rise towards the top tier of the unforgiving pyramid of corporations was just beginning. They had managed to stay neutral for decades and even when they must pick sides, they were at least sympathetic in the eyes of the opponents.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>It all changed when they declared an overly ambitious project: Transcendence.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>All of a sudden, they became a threat to all big corporations, cartels, syndicates, and trusts.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>We will continue our journey on the backstory of the game next week.

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>What is better than exploring the universe, traveling between planets, space stations, and colonies while pursuing adventures in a state-of-art spaceship?</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Doing all these actions with charismatic, unique, and deep characters, of course!</span></p>
<p class=""><span>The journey you are about to embark on will require a lot of help, anyway.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Here at Metaverse Studios, we believe one of the most important features of Angelic will be the companions, or heroes, you meet throughout your adventure. They can be your friends, lovers, enemies… Or simply be indifferent towards you. Regardless of their view of you, they will always be significant.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Angelic is not a game where the entire fate of the universe falls into your hands. Absolutely not. That is the most senseless, unreasonable, and unrealistic cliché you can imagine.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>However, you can still have a solid impact on many lives: Save them, doom them or ignore them. You can achieve great things or fail miserably. But whatever you are planning to do, know that you cannot achieve what you desire all by yourself. You will need help, like it or not.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>You will need allies.</span></p>
<h2><b>Not an Easy Alliance</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Maybe you are disappointed when I say, “the ultimate fate of the universe will not fall into your hands” and you will need allies.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Get ready for more bad news. Because those potential allies might have different agendas, motivations, and desires. Just because you want them to assist you does not mean they will start following you.</span></p></div>

Good luck with that.</span></p>

<h2><b>Angelic is Also a Strategy Game, Afterall…</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>Apart from narrative-wise functions, heroes have also a massive impact on gameplay.</span></p>

There are many different “classes” of heroes; for instance, you will have assassin, hunter, healer, tank, and melee heroes. You will even have “sorcerers” as the old ones (humans) name them. For humans, anything that they cannot comprehend is called magic. In truth, there are no sorcerers. Just “aisars” and “atronics”. These roles will be discussed later.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>As a final note, let me underline that unlike other turn-based-strategy games, units in our game are not just soldiers with different weapons. This is a major difference in terms of gameplay. They are completely different from each other. They have unique skills, different advantages and disadvantages and they use distinct weapons. We have other cool features like drop pod mechanics, combo effects, and functional customizations.</span></p>

<p class=""><span>Today, we delve deep into the ship and its design. It is important to discuss the ship because it is home to our own character, which has not been revealed yet, as well as your companions.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>I have mentioned Angelic is a narrative turn-based strategy RPG and underlined the importance of our companions. Gameplay-wise, we call them “heroes”. Narrative-wise, they are your companions. In the next diary entry, we will talk about your companions’ roles and functions, and in this entry we will focus on your “home” in the world of Angelic.</span></p>
<p><span>Osiris, a one-of-a-kind neo-human mothership, is your home. Although we categorize the ship as a mothership, Osiris is quite small compared to other similar ships. Just because Osiris is small compared to other motherships doesn’t mean it is actually small, though; it is still a massive, awe-inspiring, ship to command.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Its most important feature is, however, something incredibly significant: Osiris is the ship of Iset the Mother. In other words, it is a ship that belongs to a goddess.</span></p>

<p class=""><span>Many revere Iset (also known as Isis) as a goddess because of her immense power and technological advancements. Like all neo-humans, she was once a human. After hundreds of years after her transcendence to neo-human form, her wisdom, technology, and capabilities have advanced beyond comprehension. She is called “the mother” because she has created a lot of neo-humans so far, most of them are significant characters.</span></p>
<p><span>Good news for you, you are commanding her personal ship: Osiris. You might ask why and how… I am afraid you will have to wait a little longer to explore the answers to these questions.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Let me continue with the ship’s design: We knew from day one that Osiris must be a sleek, elegant, and ultra-techy vessel. At the same time, the ship must inherit some design elements from Iset, its master and engineer.</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Once the form is selected, we were ready for details. Picking colors, deciding about the texture… Apart from the silhouette, we were also constantly looking for unique design elements to make the ship even more spectacular and distinctive.</span></p>
<p><span>Then Emre Aktuna, our concept designer, came up with a brilliant idea: Wing tails!</span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p style="text-align: center;"><em>– These wing tails would enhance the ship’s unique essence, as well as serve as a cool design element and visual effects material. We all fell in love with the idea, and the only problem was achieving this in-engine in real time. –</em><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: left;"> </span></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><h2><b>Lord of Dead and Rebirth</b></h2>
<p class=""><span>We realized we still did not pick a name to the ship on that point. I spent some time to find a proper one, but once I came up with the name of Osiris, everybody liked that name. Why? Its metaphorical meaning was cool and appropriate, and its mythological relevance with Iset (Isis) was quite fitting.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Osiris has a lot of compartments. We only are able to show you the command information center, or CIC in short, during the Kickstarter campaign. Depending on our speed, we want to show you its massive corridor as well. That corridor is a hallway that leads different rooms such as your companions’ private quarters, core room, ship’s very own bar, prison, lab, docks, etc.…</span><span> </span></p>
<p class=""><span>Each compartment of Osiris is significant. Companions’ own quarters are their homes, each one of them will be different and unique, and will present tons of role-playing options.</span></p></div>

				<span class="et_pb_image_wrap "><img src="https://angelicthegame.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Angelic_Osiris-Front-and-Back-1024x576-1.png" alt="" title="Angelic_Osiris-Front-and-Back-1024x576" /></span>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p class=""><span>Ship’s bar is also a cool place to kill some time, but also an important area to enhance your relationships with your heroes, sometimes heal some wounds, and of course mostly for fun. Also, I am trying to be incredibly careful here not to give any early spoilers but, our bar will have awesome music…</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Prison, lab, docks, and core room will also present additional functionalities. However, we do not want to overpromise anything, so all these rooms and mentioned features depend on our budget. Hero quarters and the bar (it even has a cool name: The Pit) have the priority.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>I will be discussing some of these rooms in more detail later, especially the bar and hero quarters. Also, we spend some time on heroes (companions) and how they play a significant role in this game. This is just a beginning to our journey to the gameplay and the narrative side of the project.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>To conclude this diary entry, I want to briefly talk about our goal with Osiris. Commanding a cool spaceship and venturing forth into the vast, dark, and frightening, yet curious deep space was always my dream. It is obvious that I cannot personally experience this in my lifetime. At least, though, thanks to Angelic, we can enjoy a similar experience virtually.</span></p>
<p><span>Even the possibility of wandering inside my ship, enjoying small and smart design details of its architecture, looking to the infinite blackness of the space through the glass corridors of the ship, and drinking with my friends after a challenging mission is so thrilling. So inspiring.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Yes, inspiring. I think that is a perfect keyword for Osiris. That is what we are trying to achieve. I hope you also admire what we are doing here, already inspired by the game, and will support us to achieve our dreams.</span></p>
<p class=""><span>Or shall I say, *our* dreams?</span></p></div>
